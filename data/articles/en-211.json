    "content": "A third person has been arrested in connection with a Just Stop Oil protest in which part of Stonehenge was covered in orange powder paint.\nCampaigners sprayed the substance on the historic site near Salisbury, Wiltshire, at about 12:00 BST on Wednesday 19 June. A man aged in his 30s, from Essex, was detained by Met Police officers on Thursday. \nHe has been arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting criminal damage, aiding and abetting unauthorised entry and damage to an ancient monument, and aiding and abetting aggravated trespass. He has been released on bail.\nTwo other people, a man in his 70s and a woman in her 20s, were previously arrested in connection with the incident. They remain on bail.\nFollowing the protest, English Heritage said experts had quickly removed the orange powder from the stones.\nIt confirmed there appeared to be no visible damage from the paint but the act of removing it could erode the fragile stone and damage the lichens.\nJust Stop Oil said the motivation behind the incident was to demand the next UK government end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.
