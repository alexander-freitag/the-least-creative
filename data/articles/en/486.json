It's on track to make about $240 million of revenue this year, and has grown by about 20% for the past three years.\nBlackRock said in a press release that the tie-up would bolster its offering to clients, bring with it some 4,000 relationships, and give a boost to Aladdin, its portfolio-management software.\n\"Bringing together Preqin's data and research tools with Aladdin's complementary workflow capabilities in a unified platform will create a preeminent private markets technology and data provider,\" BlackRock said.\nThe takeover marks BlackRock's latest foray into the alternative investment world.
