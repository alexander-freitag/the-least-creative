{"id": 40, "title": "FCC Wants to Make Unlocking Your Phone to Switch Carriers Much Easier", "timestamp": "2024-06-28T15:45:00Z", "content": "Mobile wireless service providers have consumers stuck in a trap at the moment. They\u2019ve deliberately made switching to another carrier an extremely difficult process that usually involves paying off the phone and fulfilling other contractual obligations. On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission released a proposal for a new rule that would require carriers to unlock customers\u2019 phones within 60 days of activation and grant them the freedom to easily pick another service.\nThis is pretty much all the intel we have on the matter for now, the details are going to be released in full at an upcoming Open Meeting on July 18. The FCC will vote on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on this date and put together a clear set of guidelines for all wireless service providers. The meeting will also go over the rules on whether the 60-day unlocking requirement should be applied to existing contracts and discuss whether or not smaller providers, new entrants, or resellers can take advantage of it.\nThough we\u2019re still slightly in the dark about the ins and outs of this proposal, the brief announcement has at least gotten the ball rolling on a welcome change that should have happened a long time ago. Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel says \u201cWhen you buy a phone, you should have the freedom to decide when to change service to the carrier you want and not have the device you own stuck by practices that prevent you from making that choice.\u201d\nThe proposal means good news not just for customers but for  service providers, too. With increased flexibility to switch services, there will be a rise in healthy competition among  providers and reduced risk of carrier monopoly.\n\nJessica RosenworcelSIM lock \n\n          The FCC is forcing ISPs to break down the costs of their internet bills, including hidden fees, to customers thanks to its new \"nutrition labels.\"\n        \n\n          Leave your carrier once and for all by unlocking your Samsung device.\n        \n\n          Legislation regulating the use of a person's likeness in computer-generated imagery has been introduced, following the Taylor Swift deepfake debacle.\n        \n\n          AI technology is already disrupting America's democratic process, and the FCC would like to outlaw generative-AI robocalls before the 2024 election gets going.\n        \n\n          Apple, Google and Meta have internet regulators\u2019 nod to unleash even more VR and AR Goggles, glasses, and more without seeking a license.\n        \n\n          It's the first step in bringing back open internet protections.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n\u00a92024 GIZMODO USA LLC.
