But then I end up with messenger bags and backpacks that feel too bulky to carry around every day. If I opt for the smaller one, it's often too small to fit the things I need and ends up overstuffed. The item I often carry with me that seems to complicate this issue is the 11-inch iPad Pro. It's light but rigid, and in small bags it can feel like carrying around a plank of wood flapping against your leg. Smaller bags can also be too narrow, making it a tight fit for any other items you want to carry. WaterField's Shinjuku Messenger aims to solve some of these problems with a design purpose-built for the iPad.\nComing out of the box, it seemed way too small. There was no way this one was going to comfortably fit my iPad, water bottle, chargers, and other stuff. It seemed doomed to be one of the tiny messengers that couldn't quite cut it.\nUntil I started putting stuff inside. The iPad slipped into the padded tablet sleeve with ease, a narrow water bottle fit comfortably at the bottom of the main pocket. The other inward-facing pockets were spacious and expanded a bit as I put in a charger, my wallet, a pair of earbuds, and a sunglasses case. There was room for everything, and the bag wasn't even filled to capacity. Its exterior shape still felt soft and pliable, not taut and filled to the brim the way an overloaded messenger can feel. Flipping open the lid, everything was within view, and every item was reachable without moving anything\u2014a must for any bag as far as I'm concerned.\nSlung across my body, it didn't even look like a messenger bag. Even fully laden, it looked smaller\u2014more like a purse or just a small crossbody for your phone and a few other items. I also noticed how evenly distributed the weight felt. The straps attach to the bag itself at a slight angle, rather than being sewn on straight up and down; it's just enough of a direction to the bag that it falls against your body nicely no matter where you have it slung\u2014hip, lower back, front, across your chest, hung from one shoulder. It's the kind of quiet, intuitive design flourish that tells you this bag was designed by people who know what they're doing.\nAdjusting the strap is also easy as you can lengthen or shorten it without taking it off. The strap itself is a thick weave, almost like a car seatbelt. It is a bit thinner than the straps on other WaterField bags I've used, and the edges are a little hard and can rub against your neck uncomfortably, though like other WaterField straps they\u2019ll probably soften up over time.\nThe top flap seals with a magnetic closure. It's strong and snappy but not so strong that you have to fight it. As with all magnetic closures though, I worry about their durability over time. I have a couple other WaterField bags I\u2019ve tested, and the magnetic closures are still going strong on those, but I\u2019ve lost so many bags to the wear and tear of magnetic closures abrading themselves free from canvas that I\u2019m inherently distrustful. I didn\u2019t notice any unusual wear and tear on the canvas where the magnets sit while testing, which is always a good sign.\nThe interior is bright orange with a textured pattern. That\u2019s one of my favorite things about WaterField Designs. I\u2019ve come to dislike bags with dark-colored interiors; it\u2019s way too easy to lose things in the dark. Against a bright color, I can always spot a missing hair tie.\nI tested the black canvas version with leather accents on the flap. I was a little wary of its material construction; canvas can be finicky and scuff easily, or become waterlogged at the mere sight of a raincloud. This canvas, WaterField assured, was different. It's a material called X11 Cotton from X-Pac, a company that spun off from Dimension-Polyant, a manufacturer of high-performance sailcloth. According to X-Pac, the material is a specially treated canvas with an inner layer of fibers woven in a diamond pattern to enhance durability and weight distribution, and it's also water-resistant. That waterproofing is achieved via a PFAS-free DWR coating. X-Pac makes other DWR materials that do use PFAS, but I confirmed with WaterField and X-Pac that the X11 Cotton is PFAS-free.\nWaterfield Designs Shinjuku Messenger Bag\nRating: 9/10\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Everything inside stayed dry, and rain pooled and rolled off its exterior. In submersion testing, I got the canvas to soak up a little water, but to do that I had to sink a corner in water and squeeze it over and over it like a sponge. The DWR coating will definitely keep your devices safe during just about any rainstorm you might encounter, but the top is still a flap closure, so water could get in through the sides if we're talking hurricane-force winds and sideways rain.\nThe Shinjuku is also impressively abrasion-resistant. I scuffed it against more than a few concrete walls during everyday use (I\u2019m clumsy, okay?). I stress-tested it against house keys, concrete, and shoes, and I didn\u2019t get any scuffs that didn\u2019t go away after just rubbing them with my fingers. Pet hair does cling to it, so expect to give it an occasional lint brushing if you have cats.\nI don't always notice when a tester product has made its way into my everyday life outside of testing. When it happens, it's just as natural as breathing. You just reach for the thing that does what you need for a given job without thinking about it. That was what happened with the Shinjuku.\nI didn't even realize that I'd grabbed that bag when I was headed out for an appointment. I knew I needed my iPad, my glasses, and a few other things. They were already there in the bag, so I just grabbed the strap and headed out the door. For real-life stuff, I usually take a minute to unpack whichever bag I'm testing and put everything back in my actual everyday carry bag. But with the Shinjuku, I never felt the need to.\nWaterfield Designs Shinjuku Messenger Bag\nRating: 9/10\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.
