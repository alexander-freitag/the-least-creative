See our ethics statement.\nMeta is testing a feature for its Quest headsets that allows you to place windows freely, similar to the\u00a0Apple Vision Pro. Multitasking with multiple windows has been part of Meta Horizon OS (formerly Meta Quest OS) for a few years now, but currently, it only supports three virtual windows docked in a side-by-side layout. \nRoadtoVR points out this demonstration video from a data miner named Luna, who spotted the experimental feature in version 67 of the Meta Quest Public Test Channel.\nIt brings the Quest 3, in particular, a step closer to Apple\u2019s spatial computing when used in mixed reality mode, but from the video, it doesn\u2019t seem to work quite the same way. You can freely move up to three windows from 2D apps \u2014 such as the browser or OS windows like your library and settings \u2014 around your space and keep another three docked. \nOther demos suggest that the windows will only remember their placement within a limited distance and return to their default positions should you switch orientation or reset the view. We haven\u2019t tested it yet ourselves to know the full limitations here, but it looks promising. \nThe update also allows you to switch between curved and flat windows, as well as a dimmer that lowers the brightness of virtual environments while using 2D apps. (The latter doesn\u2019t yet work for passthrough mode.)\nThe Apple Vision Pro allows you to move windows around whichever space you\u2019re in and keep them locked in place even while you move around and after you take the headset off. That way, you can have a window sitting next to your refrigerator and another positioned alongside the TV in your living room, and then walk to and from the windows as if they\u2019re actual objects. \nI\u2019ve seen more ads lately that highlight the Quest 3\u2019s productivity potential instead of just the gaming-centric ones. While Meta\u2019s headset might not handle that with the same pizzazz as the Vision Pro just yet, considering it costs $3,000 less, it really doesn\u2019t have to.\n / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
