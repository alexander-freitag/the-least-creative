Previously, individual teams within the company could decide where employees were expected to work, but Jassy\u2019s email revealed that starting on May 1st, 2023, most Amazon employees were expected to work from the office at least three days per week. (Some roles, such as salespeople and customer support, were exempted.)\nIn response, thousands of Amazon employees signed petitions against the new mandate and staged a walkout several months later. Despite the protests and pushback, according to a report by Insider, in a meeting in early August 2023, Jassy reaffirmed the company\u2019s commitment to employees returning to the office for the majority of the week.\nThe NLRB complaint alleges Amazon \u201cinterrogated\u201d employees about the walkout using its internal Chime system. The employee was first put on a performance improvement plan by Amazon following their organizing efforts for the walkout and later \u201coffered a severance payment of nine weeks\u2019 salary if the employee signed a severance agreement and global release in exchange for their resignation.\u201d \nAccording to the NLRB\u2019s lawyers, all of that was because the employee engaged in organizing, and the retaliation was intended to discourage \u201c...protected, concerted activities.\u201d\nThe name of the employee in the NLRB complaint is redacted.
