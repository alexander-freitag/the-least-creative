Highlights include its fuel efficiency, smooth ride, and quick acceleration, along with its heated seats, moonroof, and 18-inch sport alloy wheels.\nThe RAV4 Hybrid XSE all-wheel-drive SUV has extensive safety features, such as automatic high beams, lane-tracing assist, and pedestrian detection, that come with the Toyota Safety Sense package.\nAs an automotive journalist, I test-drive new vehicles all the time. The standard RAV4 Hybrid model starts at $31,475, but I drove the XSE model, which comes with the XSE technology package and costs $42,909.\nI liked it, but the 2024 model isn't significantly better than the 2023 model, so it could be worth it for budget-friendly drivers to consider an older model.\nThe XSE technology package includes front and rear parking assist with automatic braking; a smart keys system; wireless smartphone charging; an eight-way power driver's seat with memory function; and a 12.3-inch color gauge cluster control system.\nThe XSE also has a sport-tuned suspension and bigger tech on the dash. The base model is just fine for those who want a hybrid at a reasonably modest price point.\nYou can also choose the XSE weather package, which features a heated leather-trimmed steering wheel and rain-sensing variable intermittent windshield wipers with a deicer function. This package is great for drivers who live in harsher climates.\nThe model I drove was equipped with all-weather floor liners, which help drivers keep the car spotless \u2014 especially if they're driving on dirt roads or mudding on their day off.\nOn the outside, this Toyota is cute and compact. The one I drove was finished in cavalier blue with multispoke black rims.\nInside, the SUV has vegan leather with nice stitching throughout. This trim specifically featured blue embroidery thread on the seating, a high-end detail that made the interior feel posh. I loved the blue stitching. Toyota doesn't skimp on interior materials, so it feels like a modern, well-made SUV.\n\n                                Related stories\n                              \nThere are a lot of thoughtful details in the dash and inside the car, including the JBL infotainment system, which creates the perfect mood while driving. Heated front seats make this hybrid SUV extra comfortable. Even the back seats feature air vents with the dual-zone system setup.\nI loved the panoramic moonroof upgrade, which gave the interior a great ambiance for the driver and passengers. This vehicle has many gadgets for the driver, including an audio multimedia system with six speakers, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto.\nThe Toyota Safety Sense features are designed to ensure this SUV's safety. These include pre-collision and pedestrian detection; radar cruise control; steering and lane-tracing assist; automatic high beams; an anti-theft system with an alarm; a backup camera; blind-spot monitoring; rear cross-traffic alerts; and more. This vehicle also has a five-star government safety rating.\nDuring inclement weather, the bird's-eye-view feature allowed me to toggle a switch on my rearview mirror to turn it into a screen showing a real-time rear-camera view. I'd definitely use this during the rainy months, when the weather can limit vision. The rearview mirror also features auto-dimming, so the lights from the car behind you can't blind you.\nThe RAV4 Hybrid is comparable to the RAV4 Prime and a competitor, the Kia Sportage Hybrid, which has a redesign for 2024 and was named U.S. News and World Report's best hybrid SUV for the money in 2023.\nThe RAV4 Hybrid has 219 total horsepower and runs on a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with electronic variable transmission and electronic on-demand all-wheel drive. This power is suitable for this size of SUV.\nThe vehicle's hybrid mode combined with the engine gives a decent score of 41 mpg in the city and 38 mpg on the highway. On eco mode, it gets quiet and automatically turns off the engine when you stop, kicking back on when you exceed a certain speed limit.\nThis vehicle feels nimble and responsive, and the torque feels instinctive. When you hit the gas the car powers forward \u2014 there's no lag. You wouldn't know you're driving an SUV because of its responsiveness, quick horsepower, and four-wheel drive. It offers a smooth ride, nice acceleration and handling, and a sport mode for off-roading enthusiasts.\nThis Toyota SUV is a great vehicle for all types of driving, whether in the city or outside it.\nOverall, I found it easy on the eyes \u2014 an exciting compact SUV that I enjoyed driving. There's no uncomfortable seat in this vehicle, even in the back, so when you're ready for a long vacation with your family, this is the perfect hybrid SUV to do it in.\nWhen I'm next in the market for a hybrid crossover SUV, I'll consider the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid XSE \u2014 but I wish it didn't cost as much as it does, especially considering how many other options are on the market for $40,000 or less.\n\n                                Read next\n                              \nJump to", "keywords": ["luxurious", "hybrid", "suv", "2024", "toyota", "rav4", "xse", "all-wheel-drive", "safety", "features", "fuel-efficient", "smooth-ride", "quick-acceleration"], "language": "en", "translation": "The 2024 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid SUV is fun to drive and has luxurious interior features.
