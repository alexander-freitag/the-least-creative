The first presidential debate did little to ease fears about the candidates\u2019 ages. They are scheduled to face off again on Sept. 10.\n\n                President Joe Biden and former President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump participate in the first presidential debate of the 2024 elections at CNN's studios in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 27, 2024. \n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nNPR's Domenico Montanaro analyzes the key points of the debate and writes: \nBiden clearly did not have a good debate Thursday night \u2014 and it has set off a brand-new round of worries in Democratic circles.\n\u201cSometimes the spin don\u2019t spin,\u201d one Democratic strategist told me during the first general-election presidential ate.\nOthers are going so far as to say that the party might need to think about replacing Biden at the Democratic National Convention this summer. That\u2019s highly unlikely, but the 81-year-old\u2019s performance did nothing to reassure the kinds of voters who already had concerns about Biden's age and ability to handle four more years in office.\nThat said, even though Biden woefully underperformed and Republicans are thrilled with the debate, Trump had some rough moments, too. He spread myriad falsehoods, did little to credibly defend his conduct on and before the Jan. 6 siege on the Capitol, and he used the kind of hyperbolic and vituperative language that has long turned off swing voters.\nAmericans have said they are unhappy with their choices, and in this, the biggest moment yet of the 2024 presidential campaign, it was clear why. \u2014 Domenico Montanaro.\u2014All Oklahoma schools are required to incorporate the Bible and the Ten Commandments in their curriculums, the state\u2019s chief education officer announced in a memorandum Thursday. At a State Board of Education meeting, Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters said the Bible is \u201cone of the most foundational documents used for the Constitution and the birth of our country.\u201d The announcement drew immediate backlash. \nIranians are voting to elect a successor to the late Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash last month. For hardliners who want more power, the goal is to maintain their grip on the presidency, and critics say the Guardian Council \u2013 which controls the selection of candidates -- has laid the groundwork for that to happen. That is not the same as keeping a grip on power. In Iran, the power to make major decisions rests with Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader.
