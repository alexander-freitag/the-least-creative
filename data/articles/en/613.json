[nzherald.co.nz]\nThe problem with chemicals like BPA is that they are great pretenders - similar in their molecular structure to hormones, particularly the female hormone estrogen.\nSo good is their disguise, they can fool the body into believing it is reacting to a natural hormone. The sort of health problems that can result from such an interaction include reduced sperm count, early puberty in girls and increased incidence of breast and testicular cancer.\nCanned foods, with plastic linings, are put into the cans at the factor hot and then sealed to prevent bacterial growth.\nHot food in a plastic lined can, especially acidic foods - tomato - leaches chemicals out of the plastic into the food.\nhttps://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/...

Unfortunatley over here glass bottles died a death a long time ago.
