I wanted to eat purely for the flavor of things. What did she mean I couldn\u2019t just eat potato chips and black olives all day for the rest of my life?\nShe probably would have loved Factor.\nThis single-serving prepared-meal delivery service is owned by HelloFresh. It has plans ranging in price from $84 for six meals per week to $207 for 18 meals per week\u2014all just heat-and-eat. That makes each meal range from $14 per serving to $11 per serving, depending on the plan you choose. There\u2019s a weekly rotating menu with 35 or more selections to choose from, plus various add-ons for things like breakfast and juice. You can select from among different types of meals such as keto, calorie smart, vegetarian, and vegan. Factor (sometimes referred to as Factor 75) emphasizes health and nutrition heavily in its marketing, and there are dietitians you can speak with for free to figure out which meals to order. (Probably see an actual doctor if you\u2019re considering changing your diet to meet a perceived need.)\nI tested this service a few years ago for our meal kit subscription guide. When testing it a second time for this review, I was happy to find that the ready-made meals have improved \u2026 somewhat. But take those words with a hefty grain of salt, because even though it might be an OK choice for some people, I still can\u2019t recommend the service.\nFactor's meals are fresh, not frozen, and arrive fully cooked and chilled. All you need to do is pop them in the microwave or oven and, in two-ish or seven-ish minutes, respectively, your meal will be complete. They\u2019re served in recyclable individual plastic containers, TV-dinner style.\nMy partner and I tried a few different meals for this round of testing, including Chicken Alfredo Pasta, Filet Mignon and Mushroom Risotto, Grilled Steakhouse Filet Mignon, Sun-Dried Tomato Chicken, Louisiana Shrimp, and Tomato Chicken Risotto. We also tried two of the add-ons\u2014Banana Walnut Overnight Oats and the Cold-Pressed Juice Variety Pack. Keep in mind that these meals are a bit bulky, so you\u2019ll need to clear out some fridge space.\nI don\u2019t have a microwave, so I heated each meal up in a 375-degree Fahrenheit oven (be sure to remove the plastic film first). And every single one of them was \u2026 mushy. I felt like an oversize baby, or a companion animal that eats only various pates and meat chunks. Even when items tasted good, they still felt like mush. Factor meals have always reminded me a bit of sad airplane food.\nThe side dishes have vastly improved since I last tested them\u2014I\u2019d happily eat that Tomato Chicken Risotto on a regular basis. Most of the veggies and sides had good texture and flavor. And every single meal was super filling. But unfortunately, there\u2019s just no way to enjoy a precooked, reheated steak. The meat hunk that was supposed to be a filet mignon mushed when I cut into it. It crumbled apart in my mouth. And it both tasted and felt as if some Star Trek\u2013esque prototype device had been instructed to replicate a steak\u2014vague hints of pepper and caramelized meat, but served in such a way that chewing wasn't required.\nFactor Prepared Meals\nRating: 6/10\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nIf I weren\u2019t dedicated to reviewing these items by themselves, I\u2019d sprinkle them with some croutons, veggies, Parmesan crisps, or something to break up the texture more. But alas, I\u2019m just a reviewer, eating my slop from a trough.\nEvery meal had the same porridge-like consistency. It was unappetizing having to tell my brain that we were eating meat such as shrimp or chicken when it was very apparent that under normal circumstances, my food wouldn\u2019t be mushy. I washed them down with the cold-pressed juices, which were great. No complaints there.\nSo who would enjoy this meal kit service? If you hate cooking and absolutely refuse to touch a stovetop burner, or you\u2019re usually relying on premade meals, then Factor is probably healthier for you than the convenience-store prepared meals you\u2019re buying. If you\u2019re a weight-lifting fiend who simply tries to consume as much protein as possible, or you\u2019re super diligent about tracking your macros, then Factor might be a good option for you too. I\u2019m talking about the people who can eat the same chicken-rice-and-veggies meal six days out of the week. I\u2019d still argue that you should just make those meals yourself. And if you\u2019re like me and you prioritize textures as well as flavor, you could always opt for vegetarian meals and just supplement your own animal protein.\nI think Factor is for the Soylent crowd. The meal-prep-for-two-weeks, volume-eating crowd. The crowd that eats to live. And if you\u2019re a part of that crowd, the service could be worth exploring. But as for me, even though Factor meals aren\u2019t terrible, they\u2019re just \u2026 not that good. I\u2019d rather use one of the other fantastic meal kit services that exist out there, even if it means I have to cook and do the dishes, or spend a little bit more time figuring out whether I\u2019m getting enough iron. Life is too short to eat mush every day.\nFactor Prepared Meals\nRating: 6/10\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism.
