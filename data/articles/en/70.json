His father, however, also labelled certain everyday clothes items as counter-revolutionary - including jeans.\nWhat exactly the punishment is for these infractions is unclear.\nHowever, the crackdown on South Korean-made culture appears more severe.\nA 2020 law made watching or distributing South Korean entertainment punishable by death.\nThis year's report includes an account of a public execution which had earlier been revealed by the BBC, where a 22-year-old farmer was killed for listening to 70 songs, watching three films and distributing them.\nIt is thought to be the only account of an execution being carried out under the \"reactionary ideology and culture rejection law\" to emerge so far.\nA video from earlier this year showed two teenagers being sentenced to hard labour for a similar crime.\nThe South Korean report has been released at a time of increasing tensions between the neighbouring countries.\nThe North has sent more than 2,000 balloons filled with rubbish across the border since last month - some of which were found to have parasites inside.\nA meeting between Kim Jong Un and Russia's Vladimir Putin last week has further strained relations.\nIt is notable, then, that this is only the second time the report has been released, despite having been compiled annually since 2018.\nThey were previously not released in order to avoid provoking North Korea.\nSouth Korean club Gwangju FC say forward Eom Ji-Sung is to join Swansea City.\nLocal media say a man in his 60s drove into people waiting at a traffic stop in South Korea's capital.\nSome South Koreans are spending time in a cell to try to understand their socially isolated children.\nNorth Korea says it succeeded in testing a multiple warhead missile, but the South and others are not convinced.\nTwenty-three people died in a lithium battery explosion and fire in a South Korea factory.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
