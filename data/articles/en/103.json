See our ethics statement.\nThis year\u2019s Surface Pro and Surface Laptop really only needed to do one thing in order to be a success: work. After more than a decade of overpromising and underdelivering on all things Windows on Arm, Microsoft needed these new Qualcomm-powered devices to at least prove they could compete with the Intel- and AMD-powered chips on the market.\nSo far, it looks like good news. On this episode of The Vergecast, we catch up with The Verge\u2019s Tom Warren and Nathan Edwards while they\u2019re mid-review on the new devices. We talk about processor performance, emulation issues, battery life, AI features, and much more. The overall takeaway? These new devices may not have changed the PC game just yet, but they can hang. And that\u2019s a start.\nBefore we get to that, though, we talk about the internet\u2019s surprise new gadget obsession: the Boox Palma. After launching last year without much fanfare, the smartphone-sized device with an E Ink screen and access to the Google Play Store has become a hit among readers \u2014\u00a0and anyone looking for a way to use their favorite apps in a simpler, less distracting way. We talk to a few folks who love their Palmas and take the device for a spin ourselves.\nAfter that, and after we talk Surface, we take a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or vergecast@theverge.com!) about the future of PCs now that Copilot Plus seems to be taking over. Is this the end of the line for x86 and Intel, or is this just a new kind of computer to go along with all the others? We have some thoughts.\nIf you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, beginning with the Boox Palma:\nAnd on the Surfaces (we\u2019ll update these links as our reviews go live):\n / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
