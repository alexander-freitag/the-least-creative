Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. \nThe US government is suing Adobe for allegedly hiding expensive fees and making it difficult to cancel a subscription. In the complaint filed on Monday, the Department of Justice claims Adobe \u201chas harmed consumers by enrolling them in its default, most lucrative subscription plan without clearly disclosing important plan terms.\u201d\nThe lawsuit alleges Adobe \u201chides\u201d the terms of its annual, paid monthly plan in the \u201cfine print and behind optional textboxes and hyperlinks.\u201d In doing so, the company fails to properly disclose the early termination fee incurred upon cancellation \u201cthat can amount to hundreds of dollars,\u201d the complaint says.\nWhen customers do attempt to cancel, the DOJ alleges that Adobe requires them to go through an \u201conerous and complicated\u201d cancellation process that involves navigating through multiple webpages and pop-ups. It then allegedly \u201cambushes\u201d customers with an early termination fee, which may discourage them from canceling.\nCustomers encounter similar obstacles when attempting to cancel their subscriptions over the phone or via live chats, the DOJ alleges. The complaint claims \u201csubscribers have had their calls or chats either dropped or disconnected and have had to re-explain their reason for calling when they re-connect.\u201d The lawsuit alleges that these practices break federal laws designed to protect consumers.\nThe lawsuit also targets Adobe executives Maninder Sawhney, the senior vice president of digital go-to-market and sales, as well as David Wadhwani, the president of the company\u2019s digital media business. The complaint says both executives \u201cdirected, controlled, had the authority to control, or participated in the acts and practices of Adobe.\u201d Adobe didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\u201cAdobe trapped customers into year-long subscriptions through hidden early termination fees and numerous cancellation hurdles,\u201d Samuel Levine, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. \u201cAmericans are tired of companies hiding the ball during subscription signup and then putting up roadblocks when they try to cancel.\u201d The federal government began looking into Adobe\u2019s cancellation practices late last year.\nIn 2012, Adobe went from selling its creative software for lifetime use to charging users for a monthly or yearly subscription to its suite of products, including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and others. The company\u2019s subscription model has long frustrated creatives, who are often forced to stay subscribed to Adobe in order to keep doing their jobs. Earlier this month, Adobe\u2019s new terms of service were met with backlash after some interpreted the move as an opportunity to train its AI on users\u2019 art.\nThe lawsuit speaks to continued regulatory scrutiny of Adobe. In 2022, Adobe attempted to acquire the product design platform Figma for $20 billion, but it abandoned the deal last year after facing antitrust scrutiny from European regulators.\n / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
