A two-lane road cuts its way through the hilly, rugged countryside.\nDany Azar walks about a hundred feet down that road before he stops at a stone ledge, and prepares to ascend the embankment.\nIn part, the paleontologist chooses field sites like this one \u2014 near a roadway, close to civilization \u2014 to avoid having to traverse long distances by foot.\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit lazy,\u201d he says with a smile.\nBut there\u2019s another reason, too: Such a thoroughfare also cuts away the hillside to make its layers accessible.\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a look,\u201d Azar says, as he climbs upon the ledge. After a few paces, he steps onto the rise and makes his way up the steep and crumbly face. The air is cool and the cloudless sky is a deep blue.\n\n                 Azar searches for amber along a rocky face in the area of Hadath el Joubbeh in 2023. \n                \n                    \n                    Sibelle Maksoud/Danny Azar\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nAzar, who holds a joint position at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology in China and the Lebanese University, stares at the dirt and rocks before him. It doesn\u2019t look like much \u2014 but he knows what he\u2019s after.\nBefore long, Azar stops. Among the dirt and stones at his feet, he spots a piece of amber not much bigger than a grain of rice. Then he spots another, and another \u2014 shiny golden fragments glinting in the sunlight.\n\u201cThis is one of the 450 outcrops of amber that I discovered in this country,\u201d says Azar, who\u2019s originally from Lebanon.\nHe explains that Lebanon is one of the few places where it\u2019s possible to study a critical moment in our planet\u2019s evolutionary history. Some 130 million years ago during the early Cretaceous, when dinosaurs still reigned, the world was transitioning from domination by ferns and conifers to domination by flowering plants. And that shift \u2014 one that would transform life on Earth as we know it \u2014 is sealed within a treasure trove of ancient specimens that can be found on these rocky slopes that Azar knows so well.\nBefore Azar, researchers knew of just one amber outcrop in the south. But he\u2019s found the fossilized tree resin almost everywhere he\u2019s gone \u2014 near the country\u2019s famed cedars, in the mountains, and even along the Beirut River outside the capital.\n\u201cThey call me the \u2018amber man,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\n                 Danny Azar holds a large amber specimen, found in the area of Wadi Jezzine in 2015. \n                \n                    \n                    Simon Haddad/Courtesy Danny Azar\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nAzar lives in China now, but he returns to Lebanon a few times each year to do his field work because of how special the amber is here. It chronicles the dawn of the age of flowering plants \u2014 an ecological shift that forever altered life on Earth.\nIf a time traveler were to visit the early Cretaceous, they would find an Earth that was profoundly unfamiliar \u2014 and much more perilous.\n\u201cThere were dinosaurs and hordes of insects,\u201d says Azar. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I could be standing one minute in such type of environment because it could be very dangerous. It was a tropical climate with very humid, dense and dark forest.\u201d\nThat kind of forest \u2014 filled with ferns and conifers \u2014 was about to be overrun by flowering plants. And it was the arrival of flowers that transformed the Earth into the planet we now inhabit. During this time, there was an explosion of new families of plants that were stocked with pollen and nectar, laid out like a buffet for legions of insects that evolved and diversified over the subsequent millennia to consume it.\n\u201cEverything was changing,\u201d Azar says. \u201cA lot of groups appeared during this period \u2014 bees and other pollinators. And even the beginning of butterflies [and moths].\u201d The plants provided insects with food and new habitat, and insects began pollinating many of the plants \u2014 so these two groups of organisms evolved in tandem.\nThat\u2019s why amber from the Cretaceous is like a series of snapshots of a planet in transition \u2014 a time between two worlds.\nNot all the pieces of amber are tiny at this outcropping in Ain Dara. Sibelle Maksoud, a geologist at Lebanese University and Azar\u2019s wife, is out collecting today too. And she has turned up a chunk of amber the size of a golf ball.\n\n                Paleo-entomologist Marina Hakim (left), geologist Sibelle Maksoud, and paleontologist Dany Azar stand atop a slope in central Lebanon on a recent trip to search for ancient amber inclusions.\n                \n                    \n                    Ari Daniel/For NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a treasure,\u201d she says as she holds the golden globe. \u201cJust think that you are the first one touching this resin since 130 million years. So it\u2019s a beautiful feeling. After, we can wash it a little bit and we can check under the microscope if you can see insects inside.\u201d\nThese treasures are the product of the sticky resin that oozed out of trees during the Cretaceous, occasionally entombing an insect or a bit of plant material, getting buried, and \u2014 with time and under the right conditions \u2014 becoming amber.\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful because it\u2019s perfectly well-preserved,\u201d says Azar. \u201cThe piece of amber is a window to the past.\u201d\n\n                 Geologist Sibelle Maksoud holds up a chunk of amber the size of a golf ball. \u201cIt\u2019s a treasure,\u201d she says.\n                \n                    \n                    Ari Daniel/For NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nBy studying countless orbs of amber collected from across Lebanon, Azar has gazed into this window again and again. It allows him to reconstruct the drama that was unfolding on Earth during the early Cretaceous \u2014 how flowering plants took over, and how insects enabled the coup.\nFor instance, Azar recently found a special mosquito in a piece of 130-million-year-old amber. It was the oldest one ever discovered, just about a mile from where he and Maksoud are standing today in Ain Dara. \u201cAnd moreover,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s a male with very functional mouthparts to get a blood meal.\u201d\nToday, there are no male mosquitoes that suck blood. That familiar and annoying bite \u2014 which facilitates the spread of deadly diseases like malaria and dengue \u2014 is caused by pregnant females. That\u2019s because once flowers arrived in the early Cretaceous, Azar says male mosquitoes likely changed their eating habits, evolving away from blood to feed on a different, safer food source \u2014 nectar.\nAnd this is just one treasure among many. Azar has backlogged finds from more than 500 pounds of amber nuggets that he has collected over the years. He has numerous publications in the works involving discoveries of ancient flowers, dinosaur tracks, and new insect species that Azar says will rewrite the textbooks.\n\n                 Once the amber fragments are cleaned up, they sparkle.\n                \n                    \n                    Ari Daniel/For NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nAfter a couple hours, Azar, Maksoud, and a colleague have bagged a pound or two of amber.\n\u201cIf we go to any outcrop elsewhere in the world,\u201d says Azar, \u201cyou may pass maybe a whole day to find two or three pieces like this.\u201d\nAzar cherishes the paleontological riches spilling out of Lebanon.\n\u201cWhen you see all these discoveries in a small country like this, it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift. It\u2019s a gift.\u201d\nThere\u2019s just one problem. Azar can\u2019t get most of the rest of Lebanon to care about these treasures.\n\u201cIn China, they [would] make a museum over there,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd in Europe, they [would] protect the land because they care. Here, I\u2019m fighting since 20 years to get a natural history museum.\u201d\nAzar says that all he has received are empty promises. To him, these amber outcrops are heirlooms squandered in a land rocked by conflict and corruption.\n\u201cSince I was born in this country,\u201d he laments, \u201cthere is always troubles.\u201d\nAzar has seen people build construction projects on top of outcroppings that he\u2019s discovered, but there\u2019s minimal enforcement of zoning regulations. It was Lebanon\u2019s financial crisis that prompted his move to China, where he lives most of the year away from his family. And on this trip, he hasn\u2019t dared venture south to collect amber samples.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe have bombing every day in the south of Lebanon, unfortunately. Why we can\u2019t live some years in a peaceful way, and in a normal way?\u201d\nStill, Azar thinks \u2014 and hopes \u2014 the museum he longs for will one day be built to house his bounty.\n\n                 Azar\u2019s collection includes insects as well, including these beetles and butterflies.\n                \n                    \n                    Ari Daniel/For NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know it yet, but today\u2019s haul of golden globes will yield numerous Cretaceous insects, including a spider, a handful of biting midges, and a male lacewing likely never seen before. It\u2019s a new species enrobed in amber, buried in the mud on the side of the road \u2026 just waiting to be plucked from a place layered with a deep and complicated history.\nSponsor Message\nBecome an NPR sponsor", "keywords": ["I'd be happy to help you with that!
