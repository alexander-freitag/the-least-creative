It Did Not Go Well", "timestamp": "2024-06-26T10:00:00Z", "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.\nImagine you\u2019ve just arrived in another country, you don\u2019t speak the language, and you stumble upon a construction zone. The air is thick with dust. You\u2019re tired. You still stink like airplane. You try to ignore the jackhammers to decipher what the signs say: Do you need to cross the street, or walk up another block, or turn around?\nI was in exactly such a situation this week, but I came prepared. I\u2019d flown to Montreal to spend two days testing the new AI translation feature on Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart sunglasses. Within 10 minutes of setting out on my first walk, I ran into a barrage of confusing orange detour signs.\nThe AI translation feature is meant to give wearers a quick, hands-free way to understand text written in foreign languages, so I couldn\u2019t have devised a better pop quiz on how it works in real time.\nAs an excavator rumbled, I looked at a sign and started asking my sunglasses to tell me what it said. Before I could finish, a harried Quebecois construction worker started shouting at me and pointing northwards, and I scurried across the street.\nRight at the start of my AI adventure, I\u2019d run into the biggest limitation of this translation software\u2014it doesn\u2019t, at the moment, tell you what people say. It can only parse the written word.\nI already knew that the feature was writing-only at the moment, so that was no surprise. But soon, I\u2019d run into its other less-obvious constraints. Over the next 48 hours, I tested the AI translation on a variety of street signs, business signs, advertisements, historical plaques, religious literature, children\u2019s books, tourism pamphlets, and menus\u2014with wildly varied results.\nSometimes it was competent, like when it told me that the book I picked up for my son, Trois Beaux B\u00e9b\u00e9s, was about three beautiful babies. (Correct.) It told me repeatedly that ouvert meant \u201copen,\u201d which, to be frank, I already knew, but I wanted to give it some layups.\nOther times, my robot translator was not up to the task. It told me that the sign for the notorious adult movie theater Cin\u00e9ma L\u2019Amour translated to \u2026 \u201cCin\u00e9ma L\u2019Amour.\u201d (F for effort\u2014Google Translate at least changed it to \u201cCinema Love.\u201d)\nAt restaurants, I struggled to get it to read me every item on a menu. For example, instead of telling me all of the different burger options at a brew pub, it simply told me that there were \u201cburgers and sandwiches,\u201d and refused to get more specific despite my wheedling.\nWhen I went to an Italian spot the next night, it similarly gave me a broad summary of the offerings rather than breaking them down in detail\u2014I was told there were \u201cgrilled meat skewers,\u201d but not, for example, that there were duck confit, lamb, and beef options, or how much they cost.\nAll in all, right now, the AI translation is more of a temperamental party trick than a genuinely useful travel tool for foreign climes.\nTo use the AI translation, a glasses-wearer needs to say the following magic words: \u201cHey Meta, look at \u2026\u201d and then ask it to translate what it\u2019s looking at.\nThe glasses take a snapshot of whatever is in front of you, and then tell you about the text after a few seconds of processing. I\u2019d expected more straightforward translations, but it rarely spits out word-for-word breakdowns. Instead, it paraphrases what it sees or offers a broad summary.\nWhen I came across a plaque explaining that I was standing at the site of an old bridge, it relayed that information, but omitted details included on the original sign, like the date completed.\nReady for some AI translation wizardry (well\u2026 hopefully).\nTraveling with friends or family? Warning: There\u2019s no speaker option. After meeting up with friends, I was disappointed that there was no way for them to hear Meta\u2019s responses to questions.\nRight now, there\u2019s just a handful of languages supported: Spanish, Italian, French, and German. The AI can identify other languages but not translate them into English. When I went on a stroll through Chinatown, for example, it identified a poster in Mandarin, but did not explain what it meant.\nHopefully a broader array of languages is in the pipeline; if I was traveling in a country where I didn\u2019t know the alphabet, like Thailand or Russia, written translation would have come in especially handy.\nOn my last morning, I made a pilgrimage to Foufounes \u00c9lectriques, a storied punk bar, because I wanted to see how my glasses would handle the word \u201cfoufounes.\u201d In Quebec, it\u2019s cutesy slang for butt, the equivalent of something like \u201cbum-bum.\u201d In France, though, it\u2019s a much ruder word for genitalia. When I arrived at the (closed) bar, the glasses informed me that they\u2019d been disconnected from Meta View, the app you need to download to use most of the features because the glasses use your phone for internet access.\nI attempted to fix the connection for the next hour, but to no avail. Meta routes anyone who purchased the glasses through Ray-Ban to first contact Ray-Ban\u2019s customer service hotline\u2014but Ray-Ban\u2019s customer service rep told me it sounded like a Meta problem. I had to lie and say I bought the glasses through Meta to even access the company\u2019s customer service chat system, which does not have a phone-call option.\nBy the time I actually got through to Meta\u2019s chat, I only had 10 minutes until I had to head back. The customer service rep who was trying to help me seemed to be running through a script at a slow pace, and after 10 minutes had passed, she hadn\u2019t yet offered any advice.\nI returned to my hotel woefully ignorant of how Meta\u2019s AI translation handles French-Canadian slang. The Meta rep emailed me six hours later to see if I still needed help. I was already back home in Chicago.\nThe AI translation feature is simply too rudimentary and buggy to be anything more than a novelty. And yet, these sunglasses will be coming with me on future trips. Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses are a surprise hit for a good reason: They rule! They are both legitimately functional as shades, speakers, and a camera\u2014plus, as far as wearable computers go, remarkably stylish.\nEarlier this year, I bought a pair to replace my old prescription shades, and I\u2019ve been persistently delighted. I\u2019ve abandoned my AirPods whenever I take my dog for walks or go jogging, because the audio quality is terrific. I love them, despite how inherently uncool the concept of Meta-branded smart glasses is.\nThe AI translation feature is, thus far, still basically an experiment, and the Meta View app is\u2014at least for this traveler\u2014prone to buggy performance. But the other core features of the Ray-Bans are strong enough that the glasses are still a worthwhile travel accessory.\nAnd since Meta is shifting resources in the wake of its unexpected success with wearables, I\u2019d bet on the AI features improving dramatically over the next year or so. I'll be hoping for drastically reduced lag times for information, and the holy grail of truly live conversation translations.
