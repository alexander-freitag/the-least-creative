See our ethics statement.\nFor the past couple of weeks, Adobe has faced intense backlash over changes to its terms of service agreement \u2014 and now, it\u2019s trying to patch things up. On Tuesday, Adobe announced a tweaked version of its terms of service agreement that makes it clear the company will not train AI on user content stored locally or in the cloud.\nThe section defining Adobe\u2019s access to user content now includes several distinct categories, including one dedicated to generative AI. Adobe\u2019s updated terms explicitly state that its software \u201cwill not use your Local or Cloud Content to train generative AI.\u201d But there\u2019s one exception: if your work is submitted to the Adobe Stock marketplace, the company can use it to train Adobe Firefly.\nThese additions to the terms of service, according to Scott Belsky, Adobe\u2019s chief strategy officer, aren\u2019t actually changing anything \u2014 Adobe says its stance on AI training just wasn\u2019t clearly laid out before, leading to confusion. \u201cWe\u2019ve explicitly said we will not train generative AI on your content,\u201d Belsky said during an interview with The Verge. \u201cIt was always a policy that we had as a company. We always made that very clear, but we never explicitly said that.\u201d\nThe new terms also address user concerns about Adobe scanning content created under a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), saying the company does not \u201cscan or review\u201d work stored locally on your device. Adobe will only automatically scan content uploaded to the cloud to \u201censure we are not hosting illegal or abusive content, like Child Sexual Abuse Material.\u201d It will also only subject work uploaded to the cloud to human review if it\u2019s flagged or reported as illegal, or if you opt in to a prerelease, beta, or Adobe\u2019s product improvement program.\nAdobe\u2019s changes to its terms of service agreement sparked an uproar earlier this month after users misread changes as giving the company permission to use their work for AI training. The outcry stemmed from creatives who have grown frustrated with the company\u2019s outsize grasp on the creative industry. Even the federal government has taken notice of users\u2019 complaints about Adobe, as the Department of Justice is suing the company for allegedly hiding expensive cancellation fees and making it difficult to cancel their subscriptions.\nA lot of user frustration dates back to Adobe\u2019s shift to a subscription-only model in 2012, something Belsky acknowledged as a point of contention. \u201cI think that that was a change for some customers that probably rubbed them negatively,\u201d Belsky said. \u201cI think that when something like this [the terms of service update] happens, my observation is that we see a bit of a resurgence of that frustration. That may have been seeded back when we made that model change.\u201d\nIt\u2019s great that Adobe\u2019s tweaking its terms of service to make them more transparent, but this may just serve as a small patch on top of a much larger wound that will likely take more time \u2014 and close attention \u2014 to heal.\n / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
