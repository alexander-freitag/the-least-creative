His weak performance led to a chorus of calls for him to end his reelection campaign.\n\u201cI understand the concern after the debate. I get it,\u201d Biden told a group of supporters gathered at the home of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on Saturday night. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a great night. But I\u2019m going to be fighting harder and going to need you with me to get it done.\u201d\nThe Biden campaign had been looking to shake up the race with the debate, which the president spent a week prepping for at Camp David. They had wanted to draw a contrast between him and Trump on issues like abortion, democracy and the economy \u2014 and they wanted to put to rest concerns about Biden\u2019s age.\n\n                President Biden and first lady Jill Biden got an order to go from a Waffle House in Marietta, Ga., after the first presidential debate of the 2024 elections on Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nLess than 24 hours after the debate, Biden was back on stage for a rally in Raleigh, N.C., this time with a stronger voice and more energetic presence. His campaign used the performance to cut a new ad that it said would air on networks and programs that are popular with younger and diverse audiences.\n\u201cI know how to do this job. I know how to get things done. And I know like millions of Americans know \u2014 when you get knocked down, you get back up,\u201d he said to a cheering crowd.\nBiden debuted new talking points addressing his weak performance \u2014 something he would go on to repeat at several different campaign receptions on Friday and Saturday in New York and New Jersey.\n\u201cI don\u2019t walk as easy as I used to. I don\u2019t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong.\u201d\n\n                President Biden and British musician Elton John at the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center grand opening ceremony in New York on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nSince the debate, Biden and his allies have been trying to convince people who watched or have seen clips online that it was just one bad night and not representative of who he is as a candidate and president.\nThat started in earnest immediately after the debate, when the president and first lady stopped by an Atlanta watch party. The first lady praised her husband for \u201canswering every question\u201d and saying that Trump \u201clied.\u201d\nOn Friday, the couple attended a political fundraiser in New York, where they highlighted the false statements Trump made during the debate. On Saturday, they visited the East Hampton home of hedge fund manager Barry Rosenstein and his wife Lizanne Rosenstein.\n\n                First lady Jill Biden waves as she and President Biden walk from Air Force One in Westhampton Beach, N.Y., on Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nGreeting the motorcade along the path into the residential neighborhood was a small group holding up signs: \u201cWe love you, but it\u2019s time,\u201d \u201cStep down for democracy,\u201d \u201cPlease drop out for U.S.,\u201d and \u201cThank you, next.\u201d\nLizanne Rosenstein told the crowd gathered on her lawn, which included former Trump White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, that \u201cwe can waste time comparing debate nights, but you know what? It\u2019s more meaningful to compare presidencies.\u201d\nThe first lady dismissed the naysayers with one line: \u201cJoe isn\u2019t just the right person for the job \u2014 he\u2019s the only person for the job.\u201d\nCampaign Communications Director Michael Tyler told reporters on board Air Force One on Friday there are no conversations \u201cwhatsoever\u201d about Biden stepping aside and that they are committed to a second debate with Trump in September.\nAsked how Biden will prepare differently for the second debate, Tyler said: \u201cListen, we'll talk more about the second debate as we get closer to the second debate. What we're focused on right now [is] \u2026 getting back out on the stump, communicating directly with the voters that are going to decide the election in the battleground states.\u201d\nThe Biden campaign maintains the debate hasn\u2019t dramatically changed the race \u2014 and is touting $33 million raised between debate day through Sunday morning.\n\u201cIn modern campaigns, singular moments do not spell the outcome of any race,\u201d Molly Murphy, a pollster with the Biden campaign, told MSNBC on Sunday. She said that focus groups showed voters didn\u2019t like the substance of Trump\u2019s answers during the debate.\nThe campaign said it held more than 1,500 events in battleground states on the weekend, ranging from door-knocking to tables at farmers' markets to bocce ball tournaments.\nTop congressional Democrats took to the Sunday political talk shows to push back on suggestions that Biden should be replaced as the Democratic nominee.\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d said Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press.\" \u201cListen, if [Democrats] weren't engaged in a little bit of hand-wringing, they wouldn't be Democrats,\u201d he said, adding \u201cBad debates happen.\u201d\nNEW ON MSNBC: Rep.

Chris Coons, D-Del., the national co-chair of Biden\u2019s campaign, told ABC\u2019s \"This Week\" he thinks Biden is \u201cthe only Democrat who can beat Donald Trump.\u201d\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, whopreviously told reporters he still think Democrats can win back the House with Biden on the ticket, told MSNBC the performance on Thursday was a \u201csetback\u201d \u2014 but one that Biden could come back from.\nBut Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., had a different message on MSNBC.\n\u201cObviously there was a big problem with Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance. And there\u2019s also just a tremendous reservoir for affection and love for Joe Biden in our party, and so this makes it a difficult situation for everybody,\u201d Raskin told MSNBC\u2019s Ali Velshi. \u201cBut there are very honest and serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party because it is a political party and we have differences of points of view.\u201d\nRaskin said \u201cregardless of what President Biden decides,\u201d the Democratic Party needs him at its center.\n\u201cWhether he\u2019s the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he\u2019s going to be the keynote speaker at our convention.
