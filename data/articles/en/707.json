Yes, you can hang things on the wall using a concrete bit. Yes, you can paint the walls with an airbrush. And yes, you can make the walls flat by sanding or using plaster.\n\"The walls are the only thing that are concrete and printed in the foundation,\" Glaeze said. \"Everything else, like the electricity, the roof, the doors \u2014 they're all like a traditional home.\"\nIn fact, the only issue she has come across has been a spotty WiFi connection due to the thick concrete material, which she has combated with a WiFi booster.\n\"My favorite thing about living in a 3D printed house is really the aesthetic,\" Glaeze said. \"I think it's really cool; it's something new that's also different and innovative. \"\nIcon, which codesigned the homes with architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group, told Business Insider that aside from added structural support, 3D printing offers architectural freedom that would be far more expensive with traditional construction. They particularly lean into biophilic designs that include more organic forms with rounded edges and curves, the company said.\nGlaze said she loves how the curved walls make \"the whole house feel very seamless and clean\" and has been experimenting with different light fixtures that \"reflect really cool with the layers.\"\n\"It's really cool to see how people get creative with decorating the home,\" she said. \"I have a neighbor who's playing with different light and textures and abstract art that pops off the walls.\"\nGlaeze also said the thick concrete material, dubbed \"lavacrete\" by Icon, is not only well-insulated to keep temperatures cool against the Texas heat, but has also been \"really sturdy\" against rainstorms and outside noise.\n\"They have a lot of drills and heavy machinery outside, and I don't hear anything,\" she said. \"I am sensitive to super loud sounds so being in this house is so quiet and so peaceful.\"\nIcon said its wall systems had been tested against hurricane standard winds and also announced in March a new formulation of lavacrete called CarbonX, a lower carbon emission cement material that will be used for the remaining wall systems.\nWhile one of Glaeze's biggest incentives for moving in was the house's \"really good interest rate,\" the actual price is pretty on par with other properties in the area.\nSince the homes in this neighborhood are being sold by Lennar, their pricing is dictated by the current market, Icon said. According to the company's website, the homes range from $425,000 to $585,000.\nHowever, Icon said that homeowners have reported lower lifecycle costs and utility bills due to higher energy efficiencies. It also said 3D printing offers lower construction costs and faster development.\nAccording to the company, its robotic system typically requires two people to operate, and each wall system in Wolf Ranch took, on average, two weeks to complete.\n\"One thing that Icon told me is they do want to combat the housing crisis,\" Glaeze said. \"They want to have more affordable and efficient homes.\"\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \nJump to", "keywords": ["3D printing", "home", "technology", "innovation", "sustainable", "architecture", "design", "construction", "real estate", "housing market"], "language": "en", "translation": "3D printed houses may sound like they're from a future filled with hoverboards and holograms.
