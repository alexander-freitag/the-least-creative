It's not October yet; after all, if the apocalypse is coming, our window for pure whimsy is closing.\nThe primary lure of pop music has always been escapism. The late producer Sophie \u2014 a friend and frequent collaborator of Charli, who has a song dedicated to her on \"Brat\" \u2014 once said her goal with pop music was to make \"the loudest, brightest thing.\"\n\n                                Related stories\n                              \n\"That, to me, is an interesting challenge, musically and artistically,\" Sophie told Rolling Stone. \"And I think it's a very valid challenge \u2014 just as valid as who can be the most raw emotionally.\"\nIndeed, we've lived in a pop world dominated by Taylor Swift and refashioned in her likeness for several years. Swift's brand of confessional, verbose songwriting has influenced a new generation of musicians that came of age in her wake, from established cult favorites like Phoebe Bridgers to fresher faces like Olivia Rodrigo and Gracie Abrams \u2014 all of whom prioritize raw, unflinching honesty in their lyrics. \nNowadays, it's customary for an artist to promote their forthcoming album as their \"most personal work yet,\" as if that's an indisputable virtue or a magic spell for mainstream success. The strategy is getting old if it isn't already.\nOf course, that's not to say artists like Rodrigo and Abrams are no longer successful. Rodrigo is in the midst of a sold-out world tour to support her No. 1 sophomore album, \"Guts,\" while Abrams is aiming for a high debut on the Billboard charts with her own sophomore album, \"The Secret of Us,\" bolstered by a duet with Swift herself.\nIt is to say that ripped-from-the-diary songwriting isn't the only way to make great music, climb the charts, or capture the zeitgeist. Not everyone can write a Swiftian hit; indeed, most people shouldn't try. Some music should just be fun, even if the lyrics are gibberish.\nAs we've been reminded this year, some music is actually more fun if the lyrics are gibberish. Take Carpenter, for example, who posits in \"Espresso\" that her charms are so addictive, so distracting, they keep her lover awake like a shot of caffeine.\n\"That's that me espresso\" is a grammatically incorrect sentence, and therein lies the beauty. A simple concept becomes a catchphrase, infinitely quotable and compulsively shareable; it makes the chorus feel like an inside joke between everyone who sings along.\n\"me espresso\" sounds like a lyric written by a swedish pop music genius who doesn't speak fluent english and thats why its the song of summer\nCharli and Tinashe have their own versions of this cheeky gimmick. In the chorus of \"360,\" the opening track on \"Brat,\" Charli sings, \"I'm everywhere, I'm so Julia.\" The line is an obscure reference to Julia Fox, which most people would never catch, even if they've seen her in the music video. \nThe language of \"I'm so Julia\" borders on nonsensical. Still, that's the phrase that'll stick in your weird lizard brain \u2014 the part fueled by vibes, not logic. Across social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, people can be found enjoying a new way to compliment their friends and idols: \"You're soooo Julia.\"\nFor Tinashe, whose catalog overflows with clever, expertly crafted songs that should've been hits, one ridiculous query has finally earned her breakthrough: \"Is somebody gonna match my freak?\" \nIt became a dance trend, then a meme, and now, the song is a true mainstream success. \"Nasty\" recently reached No. 69 on the Billboard Hot 100, Tinashe's first-ever solo entry, over a decade after signing her first label contract.\nThese peculiar bops form the perfect foundation for a \"smooth brain summer\" soundtrack \u2014 though please note that doesn't mean they're devoid of value or meaning. Rather, their value and meaning are splayed out in plain sight, ready and eager for consumption. Very little soul-searching or analysis is required to enjoy.\nAn appetite (and a need) still exists for complex metaphors, history lessons, and personal revelations in pop music \u2014 but now is not the time.
