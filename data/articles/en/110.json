{"id": 110, "title": "Apple Intelligence: every new AI feature coming to the iPhone and Mac", "timestamp": "2024-06-10T18:11:00Z", "content": "By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.\nApple announced \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d at WWDC 2024, its name for a new suite of AI features for the iPhone, Mac, and more. Starting later this year, Apple is rolling out what it says is a more conversational Siri, custom, AI-generated \u201cGenmoji,\u201d and GPT-4o access that lets Siri turn to OpenAI\u2019s chatbot when it can\u2019t handle what you ask it for. \nThe company that once refused to use the term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d when talking about its machine learning features is now, as best as we can tell, catching up with just about all of the table-stakes features that Google, Microsoft, and others have rolled out in the last year. The company says the AI features will be available only on the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max and iPads or Macs with M1 or later chips, and only when their language is set to English. The features will start rolling out this fall in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.\nApple said its AI features will carry out actions between apps, as well as manage notifications, automatically write things for you, and summarize text in mail and other apps. As with other built-in AI writing tools, you can change the tone of something you\u2019re writing with a prompt. The company also says its AI features can do things like reference one app to carry out an action in another, such as asking it to play a podcast your partner sent you. \nWhen you invoke Siri, Apple says it has \u201conscreen awareness,\u201d meaning it can understand what you\u2019re asking and \u201ctake action with users\u2019 content in more apps over time.\u201d The company says this will work in both Apple and third-party apps, as well. And you\u2019ll be able to type to Siri, not just talk.\nOf course, this is Apple, so there\u2019s a privacy story. The company says that many features will work on-device, where that\u2019s possible. But when you ask for something more complicated, your device \u2014 whether an iPhone, Mac, or iPad \u2014 will make a call to shunt the request to the cloud automatically. \nApple says it\u2019s using what it calls \u201cPrivate Cloud Compute.\u201d The models that process more complicated requests are servers \u201cpowered by Apple Silicon,\u201d and the company says it will never store or be able to access your data on its servers. Also, the company says that it will let independent experts inspect code running on its servers \u201cto verify privacy.\u201d \nApple says it\u2019s rolling out \u201cGenmoji,\u201d a new feature that will generate emoji-like reactions on the fly so that when you can\u2019t find the one you want, you can just have it created for you by AI. Similarly, a new image generation feature is coming to iOS 18, called Image Playground. Apple says the feature works in several apps, but it also has its own app by the same name. It will also let developers access an API to include Image Playground on their devices. \nAdditionally, Apple is bringing AI to the Photos app. You can already search for objects pictured in your library, but Apple says it\u2019s improving how this works in the future, so you can search for things like a person who is doing cartwheels. It also added features similar to Google\u2019s Magic Eraser, like the ability to erase a person from a photo.\nChatGPT, powered by GPT-4o, will come to iOS, macOS, and iPadOS \u201clater this year,\u201d as a chatbot that Siri can turn to when it\u2019s not able to do what you ask. When it does this, Apple says it will ask your permission before it sends questions, documents, or photos to ChatGPT and that, after it responds, Siri will present its answers to you. Apple said it was starting with the best chatbot but that it would support other AI models down the road. \nThe company also says ChatGPT will be available to use in its systemwide AI writing tools, can be used to generate images, and that it obscures IP addresses. OpenAI won\u2019t store user requests, either, Apple writes. Finally, while you won\u2019t need to create an account or pay for ChatGPT; Apple says subscribers can connect their accounts to use paid features within the built-in integrations.
