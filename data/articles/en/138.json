The ban\u2014the first such action under authorities given to the Commerce Department in 2019\u2014follows years of warnings from the US intelligence community about Kaspersky being a national security threat because Moscow could allegedly commandeer its all-seeing antivirus software to spy on its customers.\n\u201cWhen you think about national security, you may think about guns and tanks and missiles,\u201d Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters during a briefing Thursday. \u201cBut the truth is, increasingly, it's about technology, and it's about dual-use technology, and it's about data.\u201d\nThe US conducted an \u201cextremely thorough\u201d investigation of Kaspersky and explored \u201cevery option\u201d to mitigate its risks, Raimondo said, but officials settled on a full ban \u201cgiven the Russian government's continued offensive cyber capabilities and capacity to influence Kasersky\u2019s operations.\u201d\nThe Kaspersky ban represents the latest rift in relations between the US and Russia as the latter country remains locked in a brutal war with Ukraine and takes other steps to threaten Western democracies, including testing a nuclear-powered anti-satellite weapon and forming a strategic alliance with North Korea. But the ban could also immediately complicate business operations for American companies using Kaspersky software, which will lose up-to-date antivirus definitions critical for blocking malware in only three months.\nThe Biden administration knows roughly how many customers Kaspersky has in the US, but government lawyers have determined that this information is proprietary business data and cannot be published, according to a Commerce Department official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. The official did say the \u201csignificant number\u201d of US customers includes state and local governments and organizations that supply critical infrastructure such as telecommunications, power, and health care.\nRaimondo had a message for Kaspersky\u2019s US customers on Thursday: \u201cYou have done nothing wrong, and you are not subject to any criminal or civil penalties. However, I would encourage you, in as strong as possible terms, to immediately stop using that software and switch to an alternative in order to protect yourself and your data and your family.\u201d\nCommerce will work with the departments of Homeland Security and Justice to \u201cget this message out\u201d and \u201censure a smooth transition,\u201d including through a website explaining the ban, Raimondo said. \u201cWe certainly don't want to disrupt the business or families of any Americans.\u201d\nDHS\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency will contact critical infrastructure organizations that use Kaspersky to brief them on the alleged national security risks and \u201chelp them identify alternatives,\u201d the Commerce Department official said.\nKaspersky has consistently denied being a national security risk or an agent of the Kremlin. In a statement to WIRED, the company accused the government of having \u201cmade its decision based on the present geopolitical climate and theoretical concerns, rather than on a comprehensive evaluation of the integrity of Kaspersky\u2019s products and services.\u201d\n\u201cKaspersky does not engage in activities which threaten US national security,\u201d the company said, adding that it \u201cintends to pursue all legally available options to preserve its current operations and relationships.\u201d\nA new lawsuit from Kaspersky could set up a high-stakes legal test of Commerce\u2019s national security authorities.\nThe order to kick Kaspersky out of the US relies on powers that former president Donald Trump gave the Commerce Department in 2019. Trump issued an executive order that May authorizing the commerce secretary to bar US transactions of IT products and services supplied by \u201cpersons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary\u201d if the transactions posed \u201can unacceptable risk\u201d to national security.\nKaspersky has been in the crosshairs of US intelligence officials for decades due to its presence in Russia and reports of its possible collusion with Moscow. In 2017, the Trump administration banned federal agencies from using Kaspersky products, a decision upheld by a federal appeals court a year later.\nThe official order banning US transactions with Kaspersky\u2019s three corporate entities cites \u201ctheir cooperation with Russian military and intelligence authorities in support of the Russian government\u2019s cyber intelligence objectives,\u201d according to the Commerce Department official.\nAsked why the government was only acting now to ban Kaspersky from selling its services in the US, the official said Commerce only received funding last year for a dedicated program devoted to these kinds of cases.\nThe official declined to say whether the US had specific intelligence proving that Moscow had directed Kaspersky\u2019s actions.\n\u201cWe fully believe that \u2026 the Russian government is either now using Kaspersky or certainly would be willing to use Kaspersky,\u201d the official said, adding that the Commerce Department\u2019s Trump-era authority \u201callows us to act proactively, even in the absence of concrete examples\u201d of collusion.\nThe Commerce Department will work with law enforcement to monitor Kaspersky\u2019s business actions after September 29 for signs that it continues to provide software updates in the US, the department official said.\n\u201cWe need to get more vigilant and more sophisticated every day,\u201d Raimondo told reporters, \u201cbecause our adversaries are getting more sophisticated.\u201d\nUpdated 8:27 pm ET, June 20, 2024: Added statement from Kaspersky.\nIn your inbox: Get Plaintext\u2014Steven Levy's long view on tech\nWelcome to the hellhole of programmatic advertising\nHow many EV charging stations does the US need to replace gas stations?\nA nonprofit tried to fix tech culture\u2014but lost control of its own\nIt's always sunny: Here are the best sunglasses for every adventure\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
