Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said police spotted what \"appeared to be a handgun\".\nOne officer then wrestled the boy to the floor. \u201cDuring a ground struggle\u201d, another officer fired a single shot that hit the teenager in the chest, the police chief said. \nHe was given first aid at the scene but later died at Wynn Hospital.\nPolice released several minutes of body camera footage on Saturday night, from all the officers' cameras. \nIt came shortly after outraged members of the local community heckled the Utica police chief at a press conference, which was attended by the boy's family.\nA candlelight vigil attended by hundreds was held for Mway on Saturday evening, local news reported. \nSpeaker Kay Klo, director at Midtown Utica Community Center, said Mway was \"tragically murdered by police officers\". Calls for \"justice\" were yelled by the crowd.\nUtica Mayor Michael Galime called for calm, saying: \"We understand the weight of this situation and want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood.\"\nThe footage appears to show the teenager pointing what police say was the replica weapon, while running away. The officers can be heard shouting \"gun!\" to each other.\nThe officers believed they had seen a real handgun, police said - but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 weapon that could only fire pellets or BB\u2019s.\nThe three officers involved were on a patrol of the West Utica area assisting with two recent robbery investigations nearby.\nIn one of the incidents on 27 June, two men armed with a black firearm forcibly demanded and stole property from victims. The suspects were described as an Asian male and a dark-skinned male - one travelling by foot and one on a bicycle.\nAuthorities say they stopped Nyah Mway and the other teenager based on these \"identifying factors\" at around 22:00 local time.\nThe officers involved have been named as Patrick Husnay, who fired the fatal shot, Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti. They have been placed on administrative leave.\nThe shooting is being investigated by both the New York attorney general's office and Utica police. \nCopyright 2024 BBC.
