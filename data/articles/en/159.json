She was the world\u2019s oldest verified person, according to the Gerontology Research Group. Her daily habits included drinking a glass of port wine and smoking a cigarette after meals (she also ate 2.5 pounds of chocolate every week). \u201cNobody else has lived past 120 since she died,\u201d says Venki Ramakrishnan, the Nobel Prize\u2013winning biologist and author of Why We Die. Indeed, while the number of centenarians is increasing every year, the number of people living past 110 is not. \u201cThis suggests that maybe there\u2019s a natural limit to human lifespan.\u201d\nIf such a limit exists, it\u2019s one imposed by biological evolution. \u201cEvolution wants to make sure that your genes have the maximum likelihood of being passed on,\u201d Ramakrishnan says. \u201cIt doesn't care about how long you live.\u201d This explains, for instance, why there seems to be a correlation between the size of animals and their life expectancy\u2014in general, the larger the species, the longer it will live. Most mayflies live between one and two days. Monarch butterflies can live for months. Bowhead whales live more than 200 years. Greenland sharks may live more than 500 years. \u201cIf you\u2019re a smaller species, there\u2019s no point spending a lot of resources maintaining and repairing the body because the likelihood of being eaten or starved to death are high,\u201d says Ramakrishnan. \u201cLarger species, on the other hand, will have the advantage of more time finding mates and producing offspring.\u201d\nA few species, however, seem to be exempt from this rule. The hydra, a small freshwater animal with 12 tentacles, doesn\u2019t seem to age at all. The immortal jellyfish can even age backward. \u201cIt suggests that aging is not inevitable and that we might be able to circumvent our natural limits if we alter our biology,\u201d Ramakrishnan says.\nThat is why understanding the biological underpinnings of why we age and die is such a hot topic of research today. Scientists are trying to find out how to manipulate cellular aging processes\u2014for instance, how to destroy senescent cells (aged cells that cause inflammation), or how to reprogram cells to revert them to an earlier state of development. Over the past decade, more than 300,000 scientific papers about aging have been published, while billions of dollars have been funneled into more than 700 longevity startups, including Altos Labs, Human Longevity, Elysium Health, and Calico.\nOne of the most promising avenues of research involves the discovery of chemical compounds that can mimic the effects of a low-calorie diet, which is recognized as one of most well-established ways to slow down aging. One such compound is rapamycin, first discovered on the soil of Easter Island, due to its antifungal properties. \u201cLater they found out that it was also a potent antitumor and anti-inflammatory,\u201d Ramakrishnan says. \u201cIt\u2019s also immunosuppressant, so it can also make people prone to infection and slow down wound healing. We need to find that sweet spot between not having the side effects and having just the [anti-aging] benefits.\u201d\nLongevity researchers are also familiar with a body of research that shows that young blood can rejuvenate old bodies\u2014in mice, at least. This discovery came about when researchers first surgically connected the circulatory system of a young and old mouse\u2014a technique called parabiosis\u2014and observed that this procedure slowed down the symptoms of aging, lengthening the lifespan of the older animal by 10 percent. Ramakrishnan notes that while scientists are still trying to identify the factors in young blood that cause this effect, \u201cthere are companies that jumped the gun and started offering young plasma to billionaires.\u201d\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re waiting for all these things to happen there are things we can do.\u201d Ramakrishnan notes. \u201cThis is likely similar to the advice your grandparents gave you. Eat moderately, eat healthy diets, get enough sleep and exercise. It turns out that each of those affects the other two so it\u2019s really a virtuous cycle. If you do all of them at once, it works better than any medicine on the market, it has no side effects, and it\u2019s free.\u201d\nThis article appears in the July/August 2024 issue of WIRED UK magazine.\nIn your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\nInside the biggest FBI sting operation in history\nThe WIRED AI Elections Project: Tracking more than 60 global elections\nEcuador is literally powerless in the face of drought\nRest assured: Here are the best mattresses you can buy online\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
