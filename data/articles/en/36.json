It turns out the feline\u2019s future might be more important than we think, and that its journey in the Quiet Place franchise might not be over.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen the film, which just had the biggest opening in the history of the franchise, go watch it and come back to find out just how its furry co-star might return.\nDirector Michael Sarnoski told the Hollywood Reporter that his prequel to John Krasinski\u2019s A Quiet Place franchise depended on the Frodo the cat\u2019s role in Sam\u2019s story\u2014but that it continuing on with Eric (Quinn) plants a sequel seed. \u201cThrough Frodo and through Sam, [Eric] finds this campfire in the storm that becomes the thing he follows,\u201d Sarnoski. And to our relief, Frodo\u2019s death was never even considered as a plot point. \u201cIt always made sense that the cat is passed along and would carry on,\u201d Sarnoski said. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna kill an animal, it\u2019s got to be for a really meaningful reason. Otherwise, you\u2019re just being cruel to the audience. He meant something to these characters, and I think it would have just been mean to kill him.\u201d\nHow Frodo might play into a potential sequel is not yet known, though as Sarnoski pointed out, we might have an idea of where he\u2019d turn up next. \u201cA good portion of those people probably ended up on the island that we see in Part Two of A Quiet Place. I think there\u2019s a good chance that they\u2019re there, and definitely there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019re going to see them again,\u201d he teased. \u201cI just think they did an incredible job. And I think Paramount would be really happy to see where they ended up. I don\u2019t think there are any super specific plans. But I would not be surprised if that happens.
