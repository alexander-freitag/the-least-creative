{"id": 65, "title": "New portrait of King released for Armed Forces Day", "timestamp": "2024-06-29T00:21:49Z", "content": "A new portrait of King Charles wearing military uniform has been released to commemorate Armed Forces Day.\nThe picture - taken in the Grand Corridor of Windsor Castle - shows the seated monarch wearing his Field Marshal's ceremonial dress with medals, sword and decorations. \nThe publication of the image coincides with a tribute to members of the armed forces from Queen Camilla - who in a video message she described as a \"source of inspiration, reassurance and pride\".\nArmed Forces Day falls on the final Saturday in June, and aims to pay homage to veterans, military personnel and service families. It has been marked in the UK since the late noughties. \nThe image of King Charles was taken last November by Hugo Burnand - a regular royal photographer who took the official pictures of the King's coronation in 2023.\nField Marshal is the highest rank in the British Army. King Charles was promoted to the rank while Queen Elizabeth II was alive, but as monarch he is the ceremonial head of the entire armed forces.\nWhile attending D-Day commemorations in Normandy, France earlier in the month, the King wore a tan version of the Field Marshal's uniform.\nIn her video message, recorded at Clarence House, the Queen reflected on the \"incredible bravery\" of the military personnel who began the liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany in 1944.\nShe said that 80 years on, the \"same spirit and those same qualities remain much in evidence throughout our Armed Forces\", who \"undertake your duties in the face of a multitude of challenges and dangers\".\nThe Queen added: \"In so doing, you not only protect these Isles, but also defend liberties way beyond these shores. \n\"Your determination, unrelenting efforts and selfless loyalty to each other and to the United Kingdom are as enduring as our gratitude.\"\nThe patron of the British Forces Broadcasting Service charity, which produced the video, also thanked the families of servicemen and women \"who keep the home fires burning\" while their loved ones are overseas.\nNoting her father, Major Bruce Shand, and his own role in North Africa and Dunkirk in World War Two - the latter of which earned him the Military Cross - the Queen said: \"As the proud daughter of an Army officer, I know something of the impact military life has on your loved ones. You too are heroes.\n\"In times of war and in times of peace, whether seen or unseen, our armed forces support and strengthen our nation. You are a source of inspiration, reassurance and pride - and I salute you all.\"\nVoters going to the polls on 4 July will decide who will be the next prime minister.\nTony Hudgell was on his way to Buckingham Palace in May when he got stuck in traffic on the M20.\nThe Princess Royal was taken to hospital after she sustained minor injuries thought to have been caused by a horse.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are not funded by the Royal Family and have various commercial deals.\nThe plan has been put forward for when King Charles III and Queen Camilla visit Guernsey.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
