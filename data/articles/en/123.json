Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.\nLast week, AI startup Luma posted a series of videos created using its new video-generating tool Dream Machine, which the company describes as a \u201chighly scalable and efficient transformer model trained directly on videos.\u201d\nThe only problem? At about 57 seconds in, the Dream Machine-generated trailer for Monster Camp \u2014 an animated story about furry creatures journeying to a sleepaway camp \u2014 features a slightly AI-smudged but still recognizable Mike Wazowski from Pixar\u2019s Monsters, Inc. Many people noticed that multiple characters and its overall aesthetic look borrowed from the franchise, and the questions quickly started pouring in.\nWas it fed a prompt asking for animation in a Pixar style? Is it trained on material that includes the Disney studio\u2019s work? That general lack of transparency is one of the biggest concerns about these kinds of models, as Dream Machine joins OpenAI\u2019s Sora, Google\u2019s VideoPoet, and Veo as one of the many text-to-video AI tools shown off in recent months.\nLuma CEO Amit Jain said a user was to blame for the presence of Monsters, Inc. characters and that the system \u201cdidn\u2019t generate the characters\u201d on its own. The video \u201cwas created from a user uploaded image that contains the visuals,\u201d which Luma\u2019s AI model then animated, Jain wrote in an email to The Verge. Jain said that Luma uses \u201cindustry standard programmatic methods\u201d to moderate content and that \u201cuploading copyrighted content is against our Terms of Service.\u201d\nJain did not go into detail about how Luma\u2019s moderation system works and what steps the company takes to enforce its terms of service. He did not respond to questions about what content Luma\u2019s AI is trained on and if it includes copyrighted materials.\nLuma hyped its Dream Machine model as the future of filmmaking, featuring \u201chigh quality, realistic shots\u201d created simply by typing prompts into a box. Watching videos showing cars racing down a dissolving highway or an awkwardly narrated sci-fi short, you can sort of see why bullish fans of this tech were quick to call it a novel innovation.\nCurrently, Luma is encouraging people to sign up and play with Dream Machine for free, but the company also has \u201cPro\u201d and other tiers that charge users fees for more features.\nDisney hasn\u2019t publicly commented on what Luma seems to be up to, and it\u2019s possible that the company hasn\u2019t even noticed. But at a time when people have been pushing for more transparency about the datasets powering AI tools like the ones Luma is building, things like Monster Camp make it hard not to look at the generative AI ecosystem as prone to plagiarism.\nCorrection, June 18th: This story initially misstated when the AI videos were first posted.
