We have 48 hours in which to prepare.\u201d\nAll of Jamaica remained under a hurricane warning on Tuesday, meaning that meteorologists expect hurricane conditions to occur in the area and \u201cpreparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,\u201d the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n                A graphic from the National Hurricane Center shows the projected path of Hurricane Beryl.\n                \n                    \n                    National Hurricane Center\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nThe island is expected to see hurricane-force winds and four to eight inches of rainfall, with some local rainfall totals as high as a foot. A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as five to eight feet along Jamaica\u2019s coast.\nNational Hurricane Center director Michael Brennan said in a video briefing Tuesday morning that people in Jamaica should prepare for \u201cmultiple life-threatening\u201d hazards from Beryl.\n\u201cDangerous winds in the core of a major hurricane, life-threatening storm surge, life-threatening flash flooding from heavy rainfall,\u201d he said.\nBrennan said forecasters believe Beryl may have reached its peak intensity, with data showing its central pressure had risen and peak winds had dipped slightly. Still, he predicted it would be a \u201cpowerful hurricane\u201d as it continues to cross the Caribbean.\nHurricane watches were in effect for Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, Cayman Brac and parts of Haiti\u2019s southern coast. Other parts of Haiti\u2019s coast, as well as parts of the southern coast of the Dominican Republic, were under a tropical storm warning.\nBeryl left a trail of destruction in several countries in the eastern Caribbean Sea, including Barbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadine Islands and Grenada. Images showed buildings torn apart, trees downed and boats tossed around in harbors.\nOn Tuesday morning after Beryl had passed, Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the nation was \u201ccoming to grips with the reality of the devastation\u201d caused by the storm, particularly in the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique. He said at least two deaths had been tentatively reported.\n\u201cThe situation is grim,\u201d Mitchell said after speaking with a local official on the islands. \u201cThere is no power. There is almost complete destruction of homes and buildings on the island. The roads are not passable, and in many instances, they are cut off because of the large quantity of debris strewn all over the streets.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unusual for an Atlantic hurricane of Beryl\u2019s magnitude to occur this early in the season. When it was upgraded to a Category 4 storm over the weekend, it was the first-ever hurricane recorded at that strength in June.\nClimate change is making powerful storms more common. Warmer ocean temperatures caused by climate change are helping to drive what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted would be an unusually intense hurricane season in the Atlantic this year, with forecasters expecting as many as 17 to 25 named storms. \nSponsor Message\nBecome an NPR sponsor", "keywords": ["Tags: Hurricane Beryl", "Caribbean", "Jamaica", "Tropical Storm", "Weather Alert", "Storm Surge", "Flood Warning", "Climate Change", "Atlantic Ocean", "National Hurricane Center", "NPR"], "language": "en", "translation": "By\u00a0\n\n\n      Joe Hernandez\n    \n\n,\u00a0\n\n\n      Jonathan Franklin\n    \n\n\n                Fishermen pull a boat damaged by Hurricane Beryl back to the dock at the Bridgetown Fisheries in Barbados on Monday. \n                \n                    \n                    Ricardo Mazalan/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nHurricane Beryl continues to churn through the Caribbean and is expected to pass near or directly over Jamaica on Wednesday.\nThe once intensely powerful storm was downgraded to a Category 4 hurricane Tuesday afternoon with 155 mph winds, only 2 mph shy of returning to its previous Category 5 status.\nBeryl has already caused widespread damage in several Caribbean island nations and left at least two people dead as it swept across the region earlier in the week. \nThe National Hurricane Center warns of \u201clife-threatening winds and storm surge\u201d in Jamaica for Wednesday.
