He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry.\nA couple of months ago, I was sitting in the audience at a tech conference in San Fransisco watching Bloomberg\u2019s Emily Chang interview Reid Hoffman. \nShe asked about Microsoft\u2019s hiring of the team behind Inflection, a would-be OpenAI competitor that Hoffman co-founded. It was an acquisition in everything but name, clearly designed to avoid the scrutiny of antitrust regulators. Not only had Microsoft (where Hoffman is a board member) hired most of Inflection\u2019s employees \u2014 it also licensed the startup\u2019s technology in a way that seemed designed to make its investors whole. \nSpeaking with Chang that day onstage, Hoffman predicted that what happened to Inflection will become a \u201cpattern\u201d for future AI deals. We are seeing that pattern play out now.\nLast Friday, Amazon announced that it is hiring most of the team behind Adept, another would-be OpenAI competitor that raised about $400 million from top-tier investors to build, in the words of CEO David Luan, \u201ca new type of giant model that turns natural language into actions on your machine.\u201d\nAlexandra Miller, an Amazon spokesperson, told The Verge that the company had hired \u201cclose to\u201d to 66 percent of Adept\u2019s employees. In an internal memo published by GeekWire\u2019s Taylor Soper, SVP Rohit Prasad said that, like Microsoft with Inflection, Amazon will also be licensing Adept\u2019s technology to \u201caccelerate our roadmap for building digital agents that can automate software workflows.\u201d\nAdept\u2019s corporate blog post about the news suggests it was running out of money: \u201cContinuing with Adept\u2019s initial plan of building both useful general intelligence and an enterprise agent product would\u2019ve required spending significant attention on fundraising for our foundation models, rather than bringing to life our agent vision.\u201d Recent reports say the company has been looking to sell itself.\nThe reality is that building leading AI models is extremely costly, and raising $400 million isn\u2019t even enough to compete these days. Big Tech, meanwhile, is flush with cash and looking to get in on what everyone perceives to be the next big thing. It\u2019s logical for more AI startups to go the way of Inflection and Adept as the industry consolidates.\nThe problem for Big Tech is that they are no longer allowed to buy companies like they once did.
