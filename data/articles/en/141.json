These facts were astoundingly easy to ascertain. All I had to do was type some words into Google, and I didn\u2019t even have to spell them right.\nFor the vast majority of human history, this is not how people found stuff out. They went to the library, asked a priest, or wandered the streets following the scent of pepperoni. But then, for a brief period when search engines existed but it was too expensive to use them on your shiny new phone, people could call or text a stranger and ask them anything.\nThe internet first became available on cell phones in 1996, but before affordable data plans, accidentally clicking the browser icon on your flip phone would make you sweat. In the early 2000s, accessing a single website could cost you as much as a cheeseburger, so not many people bothered to Google on the go.\nInstead, a variety of services sprang up offering mobile search without the internet. Between 2007 and 2010, Americans could call GOOG-411 to find local businesses, and between 2006 and 2016, you could text 242-242 to get any question answered by the company ChaCha. Brits could call 118 118 or text AQA on 63336 for similar services. Behind the scenes, there were no artificially intelligent robots answering these questions. Instead, thousands of people were once employed to be Google.\n\u201cSome guy phoned up and asked if Guinness was made in Ireland, people asked for the circumference of the world,\u201d says Hayley Banfield, a 42-year-old from Wales who answered 118 118 calls from 2004 to 2005. The number was first launched in 2002 as a directory enquiries service\u2014meaning people could call up to find out phone numbers and addresses (back then calls cost an average of 55 pence). In 2008, the business started offering to answer any questions. Although Banfield worked for 118 118 before this change, customers would ask her anything and everything regardless. \u201cWe had random things like \u2018How many yellow cars are on the road?\u2019\u201d\nWhile directory enquiry lines still exist, Banfield worked during their boom\u2014she answered hundreds of calls in her 5:30 pm to 2 am shifts\u2014and quickly noticed patterns in people\u2019s queries. \u201cAnything past 11 pm, that\u2019s when the drunk calls would come in,\u201d she says. People wanted taxis and kebab shops but were so inebriated that they\u2019d forget to finish their sentences. Sometimes, callers found Banfield so helpful that they invited her to join them on their nights out. As the evening crept on, callers asked for massage parlors or saunas\u2014then they would call back irate after Banfield recommended an establishment that didn\u2019t meet their needs.\nThe \u201cpizza hours\u201d were 8 pm to 10 pm\u2014everyone wanted the number for their local takeout. Banfield had a computer in front of her in the Cardiff call center, loaded with a simple database. She\u2019d type in a postcode (she had memorized all of the UK\u2019s as part of her training) and then use a shortcut such as \u201cPIZ\u201d for pizza or \u201cTAX\u201d for taxi. People sometimes accused Banfield of being psychic, but if the power had gone out in a certain area, she automatically knew that most callers wanted to know why.\nAround the same time Banfield was answering calls, Paul Cockerton was answering texts. The 54-year-old cofounded AQA 63336 in 2002; the acronym stood for \u201cany question answered,\u201d and texts originally cost \u00a31 each. When the business launched, Cockerton and just five others would answer questions. They\u2019d look in books and encyclopedias, search the web, and do their own calculations to try and answer each message in a maximum of 10 minutes.\nPaul Cockerton cofounded AQA 63336 in 2002. The service promised to answer any questions via SMS.\nThe company decided that it must always give an answer, even if someone texted asking if they should dump their boyfriend. \u201cStylistically, we were only allowed to say yes or no,\u201d says Cockerton, who now lives in the English village Croxley Green. \u201cSo we\u2019d say, \u2018Yes, you should dump your boyfriend if you\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while and it\u2019s not working out. No regrets. Move on.\u2019\u201d\nAt its peak, AQA 63336 employed 1,400 researchers to answer questions\u2014students and mums could work from home, getting paid by the answer. Gradually, the business built up a database of common Q&As, and like Banfield, Cockerton noticed patterns\u2014a flurry of trivia-related texts during pub quizzing hours or requests for chat-up lines as the night went on. Yet it is the anomalous texts that are the most memorable.\n\u201cMe and my girlfriend are lost in a jungle,\u201d the message began. Two tourists in Thailand were embarrassed about getting stuck and decided to text AQA 63336 rather than call their family for help. \u201cWe called a nearby hotel, they found someone who spoke English, we spoke to them \u2026 they got the jungle rescue team out,\u201d Cockerton recalls with glee.\nGradually, the British media became enamored with the service, and in 2008 it was featured on an episode of The Graham Norton Show. Because many of the questions texted to the service were fundamentally silly\u2014118\u2019s Banfield even enjoyed texting stupid questions with her friends while at the pub\u2014answers were always designed to entertain. \u201cThere would obviously be questions that we physically couldn\u2019t answer, \u2018Where am I sitting?\u201d things like that,\u201d says Cockerton, \u201cWe worked out that the way to do it was to just make sure that they got a pound\u2019s worth of answer.\u201d\nOn air, Norton texted AQA 63336 with the question \u201cAre baboons evil?\u201d Seconds later, his phone pinged with a reply. \u201cYes, baboons are evil, anyone that steals your windscreen wipers while waving a red bum in your face is the work of the dark side.\u201d\nAfter the segment aired, AQA 63336\u2019s systems were flooded with 20,000 questions (half of which were, \u201cAre baboons evil?\u201d). But not all of Cockerton\u2019s and Banfield\u2019s memories are funny. She recalls dealing with at least 20 suicidal callers\u2014company policy meant she had to direct them to the emotional support charity Samaritans. (This was also AQA 63336\u2019s policy.) Cockerton recalls that during the 7/7 London bombings, numerous people asked why the tube wasn\u2019t running. \u201cPeople were texting us, \u2018How can I get home?.\u2019 We were effectively a Citymapper.\u201d\nTwo years later in 2007, the iPhone launched\u2014with Google\u2019s search bar built into its browser. Gradually, it became cheaper and easier for people to search on their phones, and by 2009, Cockerton noticed texts \u201cbegin to tail off quite fast.\u201d He and his cofounders sold the company to an Australian firm in 2010\u2014today texts to the service go undelivered. 118 118 will no longer answer any question, but you can still call to ask for addresses and phone numbers (calls cost a whopping \u00a32.43 a minute).\nWe now live in a strange era when customer service robots pose as humans and sometimes humans even pose as robots\u2014in recent years, companies who claim to be powered by artificial intelligence have been found to be using real people behind the scenes. Either way, what has been lost since the era of the human search engine is the joy of a distinct voice\u2014while we can now find out almost anything automatically, the answer won\u2019t be delivered with warmth or flair.\nAm I really here? How many nipples does a bear have? Where did kissing originate? These are just some of the questions Cockerton fielded at AQA 63336. Banfield recalls trying to connect people with their long-lost relatives and once chatting about gardening with a lonely older gentleman. \u201cMost of the time you felt transported into the caller\u2019s world,\u201d she says, \u201cas they were lost or looking for hope on the end of the call.\u201d\nThis story first appeared in the July/August 2024 UK edition of WIRED magazine.\nIn your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\nInside the biggest FBI sting operation in history\nThe WIRED AI Elections Project: Tracking more than 60 global elections\nEcuador is literally powerless in the face of drought\nRest assured: Here are the best mattresses you can buy online\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
