United States means that the special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s prosecution against former President Donald Trump \u2014 who\u2019s currently running to unseat President Joe Biden \u2014 may be able to proceed. In his majority decision, Chief Justice John Roberts remanded the case to the lower courts, which now have to determine whether Trump\u2019s conduct was official or unofficial. \nTrump is being prosecuted for his role in the events of January 6th, 2021.
