Britain needs to do better \u2014 as a place to live, work and do business.\n\"The scale of the challenge is immense. The exhausted Conservatives are neither up to it nor up for it. There comes a time when change is the only option.\"\nThe Sunday Times is part of the media empire owned by Rupert Murdoch, whose backing Tony Blair's New Labour famously sought ahead of the 1997 election. \nThe paper stuck with the Conservatives that year, though supported Labour in 2001 before switching back to the Tories in 2005.\nThe most read newspaper in the Murdoch group, the Sun, is still yet to announce its endorsement, although in past elections the paper has often backed the party which has gone on to win. \nOther papers to have endorsed Labour so far include the Daily Mirror, the Guardian, and the Independent, while the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph have both backed the Conservatives. \nChildren and pets accompanied some of the best known faces in Scottish politics at the polling places.\nMillions are heading to polling stations across the UK.\nPet pooches have been stretching their legs as their owners exercise their right to vote.\nA group of dogs pose for their regular \"pack\" photo outside their owners' south London polling station.\nMillions are set to pick their representatives in Westminster for the first time since 2019.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
