Dubbed \u201cthe Pop Out: Ken and Friends,\u201d the concert\u2014held at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles\u2014served as a celebration of West Coast hip-hop, and a \u201cvictory lap\u201d for Lamar after he ostensibly won his beef with Drake following the release of \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d Or, as one X user called the show, \u201cKendrick Lamar Presents: I Hate Drake the Musical.\u201d\nThe Pop Out, which was livestreamed on Amazon Prime Video, trended Wednesday and into Thursday, and although much of the chatter revolved around the performances by Tyler, the Creator, Steve Lacy, and Dr. Dre, even more seemed to focus on Lamar using the show as a chance to get in another jab at his rival. \u201cKendrick really threw his own Hatechella lol\u201d wrote one X user, \u201cthis is the hateration and holleration that Mary J. Blige was talking about.\u201d The X account for the Public Enemies Podcast wrote \u201cthis level of hate will never be duplicated.\u201d\nUltimately, it wasn\u2019t about hate; Lamar expressed several times that the show was meant to be a moment of unity, adding that it had \u201cnothing to do with no song at this point, ain\u2019t got nothing to do with no back and forth records.\u201d He did, though, perform \u201cNot Like Us\u201d upwards of four times, something that in turn fueled the online furor over his beef with Drake even more.\nLamar\u2019s show was just the latest in a series of concerts this summer that have taken viral internet culture moments and brought them to the stage\u2014or used the stage to create viral moments of their own.\nTwo weeks ago, when pop femininomenon of the moment Chappell Roan took the stage at New York\u2019s Gov Ball dressed as the Statue of Liberty, she created a near-instant meme fueled by her declaration that she turned down an invitation to play a Pride show at the White House. \u201cWe want liberty, justice, and freedom for all,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you do that, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll come.\u201d\nRoan\u2019s popularity, fueled largely by her online fandom and her inability to put a single bad song on The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, convinced the organizers of Bonnaroo Music Festival to give her a bigger stage at the event last weekend. Her performance, and the thousands of people that flocked to it, created yet another viral moment. (Search \u201cChappell Roan Bonnaroo\u201d on TikTok for a taste.)\nWant me to bring it full circle? Here\u2019s this tweet from X user @JoseRMejia: \u201cImagine [if] Kendrick brought out Chappell Roan.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time concerts have caused a stir online, of course. When Beyonc\u00e9 headlined Coachella in 2018, it nearly melted down YouTube, which streamed the performance. It ignited the service formerly known as Twitter, too. Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour is like a living meme, getting new iterations every time it goes to a new town or continent, getting its lifeblood, vampire-style, from the hyper-connected Swiftie fandom as it goes.\nStill, there\u2019s something about this current wave that feels different. People posting on social media that they saw a show and that their favorite performer did X, Y, or Z is not new. What\u2019s fascinating about this moment is how much these shows feel as though they\u2019re in conversation with the (forgive me) discourse online. Artists like Lamar and Roan aren\u2019t exactly addressing what\u2019s happening during performances, but by livestreaming shows and addressing the cameras on festival stages directly, they are acknowledging all those screengrabbers and fans with outstretched iPhones in new ways.\nThe Monitor is a weekly column devoted to everything happening in the WIRED world of culture, from movies to memes, TV to Twitter.\nThere is, perhaps, an underlying current here, a yearning for blood, sweat, and tears music\u2014if not literally Blood, Sweat & Tears. Earlier this week, Universal Music Group announced it was partnering with an artificial intelligence company called SoundLabs to enable its human artists to create AI clones of their vocals. Artists like Holly Herndon and Grimes have been doing this for a bit, but UMG\u2019s move signals another step in the robotization of music. During his set, Lamar told the crowd, \u201cY\u2019all ain\u2019t gon\u2019 let nobody \u2026 imitate our legends, huh?\u201d Presumably he was referring to Drake using an AI clone of Tupac Shakur for one of his diss tracks. The cheers at the Forum and the response online confirmed his statement. Maybe everyone just wants to share something real.\nSpeaking of celebrity memes. Justin Timberlake, uh, made the news this week when he got arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. He pleaded not guilty. There are too many memes to count, but here are a few.\nSpeaking of beef. If you didn\u2019t follow the Reddit discussion of the Pop Out, you really should.\nSpeaking of current pop queens.
