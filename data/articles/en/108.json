Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. \nElon Musk has dropped his lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, accusing the company of a breach of contract and allegedly abandoning its mission of creating AI technology to benefit humanity. As reported earlier by CNBC, the case was dismissed without prejudice, meaning Musk can file it again.\nMusk\u2019s decision to withdraw the lawsuit, filed in a California state court in February (case number CGC24612746), comes just one day before a scheduled hearing where the judge would\u2019ve reviewed OpenAI\u2019s request to dismiss the case. It\u2019s also one day after Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies if the company integrates OpenAI\u2019s technology into the iPhone and Mac \u201cat the OS level,\u201d among other bizarre threats. \nHis lawsuit alleged that OpenAI breached an agreement reached with Musk and other founding members, all of whom committed to making OpenAI a nonprofit and keeping its technology open source. \nHowever, as pointed out by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel, there were some problems with Musk\u2019s case:\nMusk is straightforwardly alleging that OpenAI\u00a0breached a contract that does not exist.\u00a0It is simply not a thing! The complaint makes reference to a \u201cFounding Agreement,\u201d but no such Founding Agreement is attached as an exhibit, and the breach of contract claim admits that the \u201cFounding Agreement\u201d is basically a vibe everyone caught in some emails.\nOpenAI denied Musk\u2019s claims shortly after he filed the lawsuit, saying the billionaire wanted \u201cabsolute control\u201d of the company by merging it with Tesla. The company also said there is \u201cno agreement at all\u201d with Musk.\u201d \nLast year, Musk founded an AI company of his own, called xAI, which has created the Grok AI chatbot that\u2019s available with an X Premium subscription. The startup has since raised $6 billion from investors to fund the costly chips needed to power its AI system. Last week, CNBC reported on emails suggesting Musk diverted thousands of Nvidia H100 AI chips that had been reserved for Tesla and had them sent to X.\n / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
