Attorney General Matthew J.

Trump Revocable Trust, the umbrella entity that owns all of the Trump Organization, including the three LLCs that hold the clubs' liquor licenses.\nTrump was the sole trustee for a few months after leaving the White House, but then hopped back out in July 2021, leaving his eldest son as sole trustee as his criminal and civil investigations in New York, Georgia, Washington, DC and Florida intensified.\nStill, as he testified at his New York civil fraud trial in October that he Trump remained the \"sole beneficiary\" of the trust and its assets. That means as his liquor licenses prosper, so prospers Trump, in contrast with everyone else at Trump Org, who is just on salary.\nTrump's apparent failings in the moral-turpitude department also put him at risk.\n\"Felony convictions are universally considered crimes of moral turpitude,\" said Peter M. Rhodes, partner at the Haddonfield, New Jersey-based firm Cahill, Wilinski, Rhodes & Joyce.\nGiven his felony conviction, \"If the license is owned by a trust whose sole beneficiary is Donald Trump, then that, in my opinion, violates the ABC laws,\" said Rhodes, whose firm has served for 50 years as counsel to the New Jersey Licensed Beverage Association.\nTrump's three New Jersey licenses are owned by LLCs, and Trump's namesake son is the president and license signatory for each one, according to records reviewed by BI.\nThe last time Trump almost lost all three of his New Jersey licenses was in 2021.\nThat year, Trump was allowed to keep the licenses after more than five years fighting state officials following a club-goer's 2015 fatal drunken driving crash.\nState officials said a golfer at the Colts Neck club was overserved by one of the club's roving, liquor-serving golf carts. The golfer hopped a curb and flipped his Mini-Cooper while driving home, in a crash that ejected and killed his own father.\nTrump's three Jersey golf courses ultimately kept their licenses under a deal struck with Platkin's predecessor, former Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal, who left office shortly after approving the settlement.\nThe Colts Neck course agreed under the settlement to only serve alcohol indoors, to provide service training to employees, and to pay a $400,000 fine.\nThe final $100,000 installment on that fine is due in October, records reviewed by BI showed.\nThe arrangement was uncommon, said former New Jersey Assistant Attorney General William Fay, now an attorney specializing in liquor license regulatory law.\nOver-serving patrons who then cause roadway fatalities carries a presumptive penalty of license revocation, Fay noted after the settlement.\n\"Given that Trump's New Jersey Golf Course generated a revenue of roughly 25 million in 2020 alone, this settlement appears to be 'pennies on this dollar' given the tragedy that occurred,\" he wrote.\nDonald Trump, Jr. did not immediately return a call requesting comment.
