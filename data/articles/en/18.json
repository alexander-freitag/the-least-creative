{"id": 18, "title": "Inside Out 2 Has Already Outgrossed Its Mega Hit Original", "timestamp": "2024-06-29T16:00:00Z", "content": "Everyone figured Inside Out 2 would be a hit, but this is ridiculous. In just 14 days, the sequel has already surpassed the lifetime gross, both domestically and soon internationally, of the 2015 original, which itself was considered a mega-hit.\nEarlier this week, the Pixar sequel crossed $400 million domestically, which is almost $50 million more than the first movie. It\u2019s also just $25 million shy of the original\u2019s $858 million international total, a number it has almost certainly crossed as you\u2019re reading this over the weekend. And it\u2019s still going strong with its only significant family competition, Despicable Me 4, still a few days away.\nIn 2015, the first Inside Out was the fourth highest-grossing film of the year domestically and seventh internationally. That\u2019s a bona fide smash, even before it went on to win the Oscar for Best Animated Film. For the sequel to pass it this fast is shocking on that basis alone, but even more so when you think back a month ago to stories about movies like The Fall Guy and Furiosa underperforming.\nThings are sure to slow down a bit with Gru and his minions on the way, not to mention a certain fourth wall-breaking X-Man a few weeks later. But even so, at this point, it\u2019ll be hard to top Inside Out 2 not just as the highest-grossing film of the summer, but maybe for the entire year.\nWant more io9 news?
