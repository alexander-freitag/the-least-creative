South Africa seemed like it had a chance of winning the game, but India thwarted the team\u2019s attempt to exceed India\u2019s 176 runs.\nThis was India\u2019s second T20 World Cup win; the team won the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007.

We wanted this really bad \u2026 very proud of the bunch of boys and the management.\u201d\nCricket is the world's second-most popular sport but many Americans are unfamiliar. T20 is an abbreviated form of the game. In a T20 match, each team has 20 overs. In each over, a bowler (similar to a pitcher) from the opposing team throws six balls for the batsman (similar to batter) to hit. Batsmen make \u201cruns,\u201d each time they hit a ball, which are counted as points for the team. There are two batsmen playing in each over.\n\u201cTo get a run, the easiest or probably the hardest way to do it is to whack the ball as hard as you can so that it crosses the boundary line, which is the end of the field,\u201d NPR's Mumbai, India, producer Omkar Khandekar told Morning Edition. \u201cIf you can do that, then you start running between what they call the pitch. And the more you run, the more runs you get.\"\nVirat Kohli, one of the team\u2019s top batters, played a key role in India\u2019s eventual win over South Africa. The India team was in early trouble after deciding to bat first \u2014 they had only made 34 runs in the first five overs. This means that within the first quarter of India\u2019s time batting, the team had averaged approximately only one run per ball.\nBut Kohli was able to help bring that average up. When India was done batting, the score was 176-7, meaning that they had made 176 runs with 120 balls, and seven players had gotten out.\n\n                India's Virat Kohli celebrates after the team's win against South Africa in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup final cricket match at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados, on Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Ricardo Mazalan/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nKohli announced at the end of the game that this would be his last time playing in the T20 World Cup.\n\u201cThis was my last T20 World Cup, and this is what we wanted to achieve,\u201d Kohli said. \u201cI got the job done for the team on the day it mattered. It\u2019s time for the next generation to take over, some amazing players will take the team forward and keep the flag waving high.\u201d\nKohli pulled off an amazing performance in his final game, scoring what\u2019s known as a \u201chalf-century\u201d in cricket, which is when a batter scores 50 runs in the time his team was batting.\n\n                South Africa's Tabraiz Shamsi, left, reacts after his side's loss against India in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup final cricket match at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados, on Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Ricardo Mazalan/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nWhen South Africa went up to bat, the team looked strong: they had made 147 runs in 15 overs in part thanks to Heinrich Klaasen. But once he was out, the team started to falter: Marco Jansen scored only two runs before Indian bowler Jasprit Bumrah threw a ball that resulted in an out.\nBumrah received the title \u201cPlayer of the Tournament\u201d thanks to his hard-to-hit bowling style.\nDavid Miller scored 21 runs for the South African team in 17 balls, but in the last over of the tournament, a stunning catch from India's Suryakumar Yadav took Miller out of the game, and South Africa's remaining batsman could not score the remaining runs required to win. In the end, the South African team was just seven runs behind.\nThis was South Africa\u2019s first time playing in the final of an international cricket competition.\n\u201cGutted,\u201d South Africa captain Aiden Markram said. \u201cHurts quite a bit, but incredibly proud.
