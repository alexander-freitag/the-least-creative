The model was capable of accurately predicting the 3D structure of proteins, which determines the functions that these molecules play. \u201cWe\u2019re just floating bags of water moving around,\u201d says Pushmeet Kohli, VP of research at DeepMind. \u201cWhat makes us special are proteins, the building blocks of life. How they interact with each other is what makes the magic of life happen.\u201d\nAlphaFold was considered by the journal Science as the breakthrough of the year in 2021. In 2022, it was the most cited research paper in AI. \u201cPeople have been on [protein structures] for many decades and were not able to make that much progress,\u201d Kohli says. \u201cThen came AI.\u201d DeepMind also released the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database\u2014which contained the protein structures of almost every organism whose genome has been sequenced\u2014making it freely available to scientists worldwide.\nMore than 1.7 million researchers in 190 countries have used it for research ranging from the design of plastic-eating enzymes to the development of more effective malaria vaccines. A quarter of the research involving AlphaFold was dedicated to the understanding of cancer, Covid-19, and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s. Last year, DeepMind released its next generation of AlphaFold, which extended its structure prediction algorithm to biomolecules like nucleic acids and ligands.\n\u201cIt has democratized scientific research,\u201d Kohli says. \u201cScientists working in a developing country on a neglected tropical disease did not have access to the funds to get the structure of a protein computed. Now, at the click of a button, they can go to the AlphaFold database and get these predictions for free.\u201d For instance, one of DeepMind\u2019s early partners, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, used AlphaFold to develop medicine for diseases that affect millions\u2014such as sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis\u2014yet receive comparatively little research.\nDeepMind\u2019s latest breakthrough is called AlphaMissense. The model categorizes the so-called missense mutations\u2014genetic alterations that can result in different amino acids being produced at particular positions in proteins. Such mutations can alter the function of the protein itself, and AlphaMissense attributes a likelihood score for that mutation being either pathogenic or benign. \u201cUnderstanding and predicting those effects is crucial for the discovery of rare genetic diseases,\u201d Kohli says. The algorithm, which was released last year, has classified around 89 percent of all possible human missense. Before, only 0.1 percent of all possible variants had been clinically classified by researchers.\n\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Kohli says. Ultimately, he believes AI could eventually lead to the creation of a virtual cell that could radically accelerate biomedical research, enabling biology to be explored in-silico rather than in real-world laboratories. \u201cWith AI and machine learning we finally have the tools to comprehend this very sophisticated system that we call life.\u201d\nThis article appears in the July/August 2024 issue of WIRED UK magazine.\nIn your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\nInside the biggest FBI sting operation in history\nThe WIRED AI Elections Project: Tracking more than 60 global elections\nEcuador is literally powerless in the face of drought\nRest assured: Here are the best mattresses you can buy online\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
