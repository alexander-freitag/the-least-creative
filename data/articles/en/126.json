See our ethics statement.\nTwo years after Lego revealed a buildable model of the Transformers\u2019 Optimus Prime that actually transformed, the heroic Autobot leader is finally getting backup with his second-in-command, Bumblebee, debuting as a 950-piece set that transforms into a Volkswagen Beetle \u2014 or at least a close facsimile thereof.\nIn recent years, thanks to the run of big-budget Transformers movies, Bumblebee is best known for transforming into a bright yellow Chevrolet Camaro. But in the original \u201980s toy line and animated series, Bumblebee\u2019s alternate vehicle mode was the iconic Volkswagen Beetle.\nAs with its Optimus Prime set, Lego is sticking to the original \u201980s designs of the Transformers characters for Bumblebee. But while Lego does have a history of working with Volkswagen to create authentic-looking brick-built models of the automaker\u2019s Beetle and camper vans, the Lego Bumblebee\u2019s vehicle mode looks like a loose interpretation of the beloved VW bug, with a dash of classic Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot cars added for good measure.\nHasbro\u2019s original Bumblebee toy wasn\u2019t a perfect dupe of the VW Beetle, either, so this might make Lego\u2019s interpretation feel even more authentic to nostalgic collectors who grew up playing with Transformers toys 40 years ago. But given the level of accuracy Lego includes with its smaller and cheaper Speed Champions sets, some, including myself, might be a little disappointed with Bumblebee when he transforms and rolls out.\nTransforming modern Transformers toys can sometimes feel as complex as solving a Rubik\u2019s Cube, but converting Bumblebee between his robot and vehicle modes appears to be a far less frustrating experience, although Lego hasn\u2019t shared exactly how many steps the process involves.\nThere does appear to be one minor compromise in the transformation process. Bumblebee\u2019s windshield needs to be completely removed before fully transforming from vehicle to robot modes, but Lego has attempted to appease Transformers fans by having the windshield itself transform into a jetpack, allowing Bumblebee to fly \u2014 some imagination required.\nOther accessories include a display plaque listing Bumblebee\u2019s stats (fans may contest his strength and firepower being ranked at a meager two and one, respectively, but for courage, it\u2019s a solid 10) and a buildable ion blaster.\nFew Lego fans like to see a giant sheet of stickers included with a set, but a pair of cute bumper stickers and a vanity license plate appear to at least make the painstaking application process worth it for Bumblebee.\nThe set\u2019s best feature might be its price tag. When available starting on July 1st for Lego Insiders (a loyalty program that\u2019s free to sign up for) or July 4th for everyone else, the 950-piece Bumblebee will be almost $100 cheaper than the 1,508-piece, $180 Lego Optimus Prime at $89.99, \u20ac89.99, or \u00a379.99.\n / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
