Sometimes that might well be true\u2014and Swiss brands certainly place an enormous amount of emphasis on the whirring ensemble of wheels and springs that tells the time.\nBut when you need the rest of the watch to match up to the same level of quality, even the most superficially unassuming components can be surprisingly complicated to get right, as Blancpain found when it set about developing a ceramic bracelet for its Fifty Fathoms Bathyscaphe.\nYears in the making, the bracelet makes its first appearance today on a brand-new collection of Bathyscaphe dive watches, the Fifty Fathoms Bathyscaphe Quantieme Complet Phase de Lune\u2014a complete calendar with moon phase, meaning a watch that displays the day, date, month, and lunar cycle, but still requires manual adjustment at the end of each month.\nIt\u2019s an accomplished watch in its own right, with a silicon escapement, three-day power reserve, and that characteristic dive bezel with a \u201cliquidmetal\u201d inlay for the text.\nBut what Blancpain is really excited about is that, for the first time, the Bathyscaphe\u2014which has been available with a ceramic case since 2015\u2014can now come on a bracelet to match.\nIt could have happened years ago; Blancpain\u2019s parent company Swatch Group owns a specialist company, Comadur SA, which produces ceramic bracelets for sister brands Omega and Rado. But Blancpain\u2019s checklist, as one of the group\u2019s most prestigious names, was very particular, and led to the development of a completely bespoke bracelet, including two new patents.\nTop of the list was a bracelet that would be as durable and resilient as a high-end dive watch would demand. The zirconium oxide used is known for its surface hardness (scoring 7.5 on the Mohs scale, beneath diamond, at 10, and above titanium, a 6), and its superior strength-to-weight ratio\u2014but it can be brittle.\nThe ceramic bracelet is constructed with multiple links joined together by pins. The pins of the Blancpain bracelet have a patented shape to both enhance flexibility and preventing over flexing.\nThe bracelet links are lined up for the heating process, called \u201csintering,\u201d during which the pieces can shrink by approximately 25 percent.\nMulti-link bracelet designs, the Blancpain team explained, are prone to failure if the spacing between links is too narrow and parts are allowed to rub against each other. But make them too loose, and not only will the bracelet feel cheaper and less secure, its links will collide in other ways.\nThe answer was a complex system of links held together by titanium bars, each one hand-screwed into position. Within the bracelet, each bar has a patented cam-shaped section that sits within a flared recess in the side of the center link. As the bracelet flexes, the titanium cam is able to move within its recess, but no further, meaning the bracelet is supple within a controlled range.\nBuilding a bracelet to such specifications requires incredibly fine tolerances in the size and shape of each individual part\u2014down to fractions of a millimeter. In this regard, it is not so different from a metal bracelet, but the ceramic manufacturing process makes uniformity a greater challenge.\nWhy? Zirconium oxide powder is sintered at a high heat in a precisely-shaped mould; in the process it shrinks by approximately 25 percent. Each bracelet link must therefore be measured individually before assembly, to ensure it comes out just right: Blancpain would not share an exact failure rate, but highlighted that it was not uncommon for as many as 50 percent of ceramic watch cases to be rejected.\nThere are more than 50 separate facets of the Blancpain Bathyscaphe case. Each one requires multiple hand-finishing steps. The size, color, and surface finish of the case changes from the first step of pressing the ceramic into a mold, through heating, and subsequent machining and finishing processes.\nFabrication of a ceramic crown involves multiple steps beginning first with injection of the material, including the pigment compound which will eventually produce the final color. Next\nis heating during which the pigment will turn black.\nOnce sintered, the links must be finished\u2014polished and beveled to achieve the level of comfort and visual appeal befitting a luxury watch. Beveling the edges of such a brittle material poses its own challenges: Comadur\u2019s second patent associated with the project came in the form of a diamond-based brushing process that could finish Blancpain\u2019s links as desired. The brand says that it alone in the watch industry hand-machines a ceramic bracelet in this way.\nThe end result is a bit like the old adage about five-star service: When it\u2019s done right, you shouldn\u2019t notice it at all\u2014but somewhere in a Swiss materials lab, there\u2019s a team that knows how much work has gone into it.\nThe bracelet opens and closes as you\u2019d hope, with a double-hinged folding clasp in titanium, and links can be removed for size like any other. It can be interchanged for sail cloth or NATO-style straps, but that\u2019s a job you\u2019ll need Blancpain to do for you, as it says fitting a now fashionable quick-release mechanism would be too likely to result in damage to the case or bracelet.\nLike the five-star service, it comes at a price: the Bathyscaphe Quantieme Complet Phases de Lune costs $26,000, or \u00a324,200, on the bracelet and \u00a317,100 on a fabric strap. Naturally, fans of the brand uncomfortable with such an RRP can plump instead for the recent $400 (\u00a3340) Scuba Fifty Fathoms collaboration with Swatch, of course.\nFor now, this Bathyscaphe comes only in black ceramic, with a choice of black, blue, or green dials. But a final piece of good news is that the patented ceramic bracelet is backwards-compatible with the Bathyscaphe Chronograph and Bathyscaphe Automatic in the same colors.\nIn your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\nInside the biggest FBI sting operation in history\nThe WIRED AI Elections Project: Tracking more than 60 global elections\nEcuador is literally powerless in the face of drought\nRest assured: Here are the best mattresses you can buy online\nExtra 20% Off Select Dyson Technology With Owner Rewards\nGet Up To An Extra 45% Off June Sale\nVista Print Coupon Code: 20% Off Select Signage\nNewegg Coupon 10% Off\n$49.99/Year Only For Peacock Premium ($4/Month)\nExplore DJI's Student Discounts & Educational Offers For 2024\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
