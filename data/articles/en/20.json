{"id": 20, "title": "White House Planning Conference for Social Media Influencers Ahead of TikTok Ban", "timestamp": "2024-06-28T19:20:00Z", "content": "President Joe Biden delivered a performance at Thursday\u2019s debate with Donald Trump that was so bad even his staunchest allies are calling for the president to drop out of the race. But if Biden sticks it out until November\u2019s election, as it looks like he plans to do, he\u2019s going to need plenty of help convincing young people he can still do the job. And online influencers might be just the ticket.\nTechcrunch spoke with Christian Tom, the director of the White House Office of Digital Strategy, on Friday who explained that the White House has plans to host a new conference in August with internet personalities. Importantly, the event is being hosted by the White House, not Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, but it\u2019s still an opportunity to let the president talk about issues that young people care about.\nOne issue that young people care about passionately is the TikTok ban, with 46% of Americans aged 18-29 opposing the ban and just 29% supporting it, according to the latest polling from Pew Research. Contrast that with Americans 65 and older. Just 4% of elderly Americans oppose the ban, while 71% support it.\nIt\u2019s not clear yet when precisely in August the conference will be held, but topics will include data privacy, payment for creators, artificial intelligence, and mental health, according to Techcrunch. The new report doesn\u2019t explicitly state that Biden will make an appearance at the White House conference, but he\u2019d be an idiot not to.\nThe president is struggling to energize his base, with the latest polling from the New York Times released this week showing Biden and Trump still in a dead heat nationally. And last night\u2019s performance at the debate in Atlanta probably didn\u2019t win him any votes.\nBiden acknowledged his lackluster debate performance at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina on Friday.\n\u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man, to state the obvious,\u201d Biden told the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don\u2019t  debate as well as I used to. But I know what I know. I know how to tell  the truth. I know how to do this job.\u201d\nStrangely, Biden\u2019s team seems to think the zinger of the night was when the president said Trump had the \u201cmorals of an alley cat.\u201d Biden\u2019s official account even tweeted it on Friday, despite the fact that it sounds exactly like the kind of thing an elderly person would say.\nI don\u2019t know what you did last night, but I spent 90 minutes debating a guy with the morals of an alley cat.\n\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 28, 2024\n\nWhile it remains to be seen whether Biden can recover, it\u2019s obviously important to remember what will happen if he fails to beat Trump. The 45th president is the guy who tried to remain in office through a violent coup attempt after he lost the election in 2020. Trump is the guy who\u2019s threatening to deport millions of people in a move that mainstream economists say would almost certainly wipe out about 4.5% of the nation\u2019s workforce and devastate the economy. Trump is the guy who says he\u2019ll be a dictator on day one.\nThere\u2019s also the simple fact that Trump is a convicted felon who has suggested a top military advisor should be executed for \u201ctreason.\u201d And that\u2019s not even getting to the extremely racist and fascist shit Trump just casually spews on a daily basis.\nNobody knows for certain who\u2019s going to win in November. But now is the time for the Democratic Party to pull out all the stops and make sure Trump never sets foot in the White House again. Hosting online creators is an admittedly small gesture. But we\u2019ll take anything at this point that helps us avert another Trump presidency.\n\nChristian TomDonald TrumpJoe BidenPolitics \n\n          A deep dive into the petrochemical industry's proposals for the global plastics treaty.\n        \n\n          Social media users are convinced Biden's stumbles might be evidence of Havana Syndrome.\n        \n\n          The court also says the President is now above the law.\n        \n\n          The DOJ intends to offer Boeing a plea deal, which may include a $243.6 million criminal fine, per Bloomberg\n        \n\n          Joe Biden's humiliating performance at the first debate of the presidential race seems to have given Trump's stock a boost.\n        \n\n          From body doubles to performance-enhancing drugs, the internet is drowning in absurd claims.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n\u00a92024 GIZMODO USA LLC.
