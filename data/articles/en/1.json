See our ethics statement.\nIt\u2019s always worth revisiting the classics, and there\u2019s no shortage of retro consoles and emulators to enable that. The Atari 400 Mini is more niche than we\u2019re used to, however, and that\u2019s what makes it so intriguing. The 8-bit retro replica console has dropped to $102 ($18 off) at Amazon in a limited-quantity opportunity that\u2019s nearly halfway claimed.\nThe Atari 400 Mini is a replica of the retro brand\u2019s first home gaming console. It comes with 25 classic titles with the ability to add more, and with 720p resolution via HDMI, you don\u2019t need to salvage an old CRT from the junkyard for your nostalgic kick.\nThe Atari 400 was one of the brand\u2019s first home consoles and computers, noted for the inclusion of a keyboard alongside its iconic joystick. It launched in 1979, which probably explains why I haven\u2019t heard of most of the games in the lineup (my feet touched the planet in 1988). Asteroids, Star Raiders II, Centipede, and Berzerk ring a bell for me, and I\u2019ve even played a few of them over the years, but there are more in the list of 25 that I was simply too late for (you can find a full lineup in our hands-on here). \nIt supports not just Atari 400 games but also emulates titles that launched afterward up to the Atari 5200. If you want more games, you can use one of the console\u2019s five USB ports to sideload extras using a flash drive, provided you have digital copies of them. That port is also where you plug in the classic joystick that comes with it or keyboards, controllers, and other supported peripherals.\nYou can play in 720p over HDMI, either in the classic 4:3 aspect ratio that CRT sets of the era were confined to or a \u201cpixel perfect\u201d mode that does a fine job of scaling it for modern displays. There\u2019s even an option to overlay your games with digital scanlines to really sell the effect. You can also rewind gameplay up to 30 seconds, and it supports snapshot saves with up to four slots per game so you never have to lose your progress.\nThe Verge\u2019s Andrew Webster felt many of the games have aged about as well as they could. Atari\u2019s had plenty of examples to get it right, after all, with so many other retro consoles to reference such as a clone of its own 2600 and similar options from long-time rivals like Sega and Nintendo. You could probably pass if you\u2019re already flush with 8-bit treasure, but it\u2019s a reasonable purchase if you\u2019re looking for something unique and obscure for your collection.\n / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\n / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
