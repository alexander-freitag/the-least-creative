But Ncuti Gatwa\u2019s first season as the Doctor nearly didn\u2019t have one\u2026 until his other TV show made it necessary.\nAt the time Gatwa was officially cast as the new Doctor, the actor was still wrapping work on the final season of Netflix\u2019s Sex Education, where he played breakout queer character Eric Effiong. \u201cCasting Ncuti meant casting him before he\u2019d finished on Sex Education. That was a risk that we took, but it was absolutely the right risk,\u201d showrunner Russell T Davies said in a column for the latest issue of Doctor Who Magazine (via the Radio Times), \u201cbecause it meant we got the best possible Doctor in 2024 that we could wish for.\u201d\nBut in taking that risk, Davies found himself needing to work around Gatwa\u2019s availability\u2014which lead him to return to an idea that he couldn\u2019t get to click with a Doctor/Companion team, but one that would work far stronger if the Doctor was absent for most of the episode, eventually becoming the fourth episode of the season, \u201c73 Yards.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI love a Doctor-lite episode. But, let\u2019s face it, if Ncuti had been available, we would never have done a Doctor-lite episode in season one,\u201d Davies continued. \u201cAnd the marvelous thing was, I\u2019d had this idea kicking around for ages, of the Doctor and his companion stepping outside the TARDIS and seeing someone in the distance.
