He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.\nThe EU has formally charged Meta with violations of its Digital Markets Act (DMA), marking its second such charge in as many weeks. The European Commission writes in a preliminary ruling that the \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model that launched last year for Facebook and Instagram users runs afoul of Article 5(2) of the DMA by not giving users a third option that uses less data for ad targeting but is still free to use.\nRegulators found in their investigation that Meta gives users a \u201cbinary choice\u201d that forces them to either choose to pay a monthly subscription fee to get the ad-free version of Facebook and Instagram or consent to the ad-supported version. Where Meta runs afoul of its rules, it says, is by not letting users opt for a free version that \u201cuses less of their personal data but is otherwise equivalent to the \u2018personalised ads\u2019 based service\u201d and by not allowing them to \u201cexercise their right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data.\u201d\n\u201cOur preliminary view is that Meta\u2019s advertising model fails to comply with the Digital Markets Act,\u201d wrote Margrethe Vestager, who leads the region\u2019s competition policy. \u201cAnd we want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalised ads experience.\u201d\nThe commission explains the part of the DMA it believes Meta has violated:\nUnder Article 5(2) of the DMA, gatekeepers must seek users\u2019 consent for combining their personal data between designated core platform services and other services, and if a user refuses such consent, they should have access to a less personalised but equivalent alternative. Gatekeepers cannot make use of the service or certain functionalities conditional on users\u2019 consent.\n\u201cSubscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d Meta spokesperson Matthew Pollard told\u00a0The Verge\u00a0in an email. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d\nThe commission says that it has informed Meta of its charges and has the opportunity to respond to its findings. If Meta is ultimately found to be in violation when the investigation concludes next year, the EU could fine it as much as 10 percent of its total worldwide revenue, which, for Meta, could be as much as $13.4 billion based on its results for 2023. The penalty could grow to up to 20 percent if the company is found to continue violating the DMA.\nMeta is the second company charged since the DMA went into full force in March 2024. The commission asserted last week that Apple\u2019s App Store \u201csteering\u201d policies don\u2019t allow sufficient competition.\n / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
