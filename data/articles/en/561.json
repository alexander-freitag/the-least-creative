Now, torn between a base that wants more restrictions on reproductive health care and a moderate majority that does not, it seems many Republicans would rather take an off-ramp than a victory lap.\nAnd yet, they just can\u2019t escape talking about it.\nThe policy high point for abortion opponents \u2014 the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision to strike down Roe v. Wade \u2014 is proving a low point for public support for their cause. More American adults consider themselves \u201cpro-choice\u201d than at any time in the past 30 years, according to a recent survey from Gallup: 54%, compared with 41% who identify as \u201cpro-life.\u201d\nThe tide is turning even as some conservatives seek restrictions on birth control and fertility treatments. A new KFF survey of women voters found that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say that abortion is the most important issue in their vote for president \u2014 a reversal from recent elections. One in 5 women under age 30 and 13% of those under age 50 said it is their top concern. Among independents, 81% said they believed abortion should be legal.\nDemocrats are counting on the issue to help turn out their votes and ensure President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection, despite persistent dissatisfaction with his leadership. Abortion could prove particularly disruptive in battleground states expected to have initiatives on the ballot to enshrine access to abortion in state constitutions, including Arizona and Nevada.\nEight in 10 Democratic women in states with possible ballot measures said they were \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d they would vote \u2014 and also said they were more likely to back Biden compared with Democratic women in other states, KFF found.\nSo far, abortion rights supporters have prevailed in each of the seven states that have put ballot initiatives before voters \u2014 including in states where Republicans control the legislatures, such as Kansas, Ohio, and Kentucky. About two-thirds of women in Arizona told KFF they support the state\u2019s proposed Right to Abortion Initiative, including 68% of independents.\nOn the campaign trail, Republicans are going to lengths to avoid the subject, even when that means distancing themselves from \u2014 well, themselves. Former President Donald Trump, who has taken a few different stances since calling himself \u201cpro-choice\u201d in 1999, reportedly urged lawmakers during a recent closed-door visit to the Capitol not to shy away from the issue, but also to support exceptions to bans, including to protect \u201cthe life of the mother.\u201d\nIn pivotal Arizona, U.S. Senate Republican candidate Kari Lake, who embraced a near-complete abortion ban while running for governor two years ago, recently said \u201ca full ban on abortion is not where the people are.\u201d In Nevada, the GOP Senate nominee, Sam Brown, who as recently as 2022 headed up a branch of a conservative anti-abortion group, has said he will respect his state\u2019s permissive abortion law and would not vote for a nationwide ban if elected.\nThe Supreme Court is keeping the issue on the front burner. In a decision June 27, the court left emergency abortions legal in Idaho, a state with a strict ban, though the issue remains unsettled nationally. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who joined the majority in an unusual ruling that sent the case back to the lower court and declared it had been accepted prematurely, accused her colleagues of dawdling on the issue.\n\u201cPregnant people experiencing emergency medical conditions remain in a precarious position, as their doctors are kept in the dark about what the law requires,\u201d she wrote.\nThe KFF survey found broad, strong support for preserving access to abortion in cases of pregnancy-related emergencies: 86% of women voters \u2014 including 79% of Republican women \u2014 support laws protecting access in those circumstances.\nIn mid-June, the court rejected an effort to overturn the FDA\u2019s 24-year-old approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, but only on a technicality. With no actual ruling on the merits of the case, the justices left open the possibility that different plaintiffs could provoke a different outcome. Nevertheless, the push to redefine reproductive health care post-Roe v. Wade continues. The influential evangelical Southern Baptist Convention recently called for significant legislative restrictions on in vitro fertilization, which its members call morally incompatible with the belief that life begins at fertilization.\nAbortion opposition groups are pressing Trump not to discard a main plank of the GOP\u2019s presidential platform since 1976: a federal abortion ban. Trump has recently said states should make their own decisions about whether to restrict abortion.\nDemocrats and Democratic-aligned groups are exploiting Republicans\u2019 discomfort with the issue. On the day Senate Democrats forced a vote on legislation that would have guaranteed a federal right to contraception, a group called Americans for Contraception floated a giant balloon shaped like an IUD near the Capitol. (Republicans blocked the bill, as expected \u2014 and no doubt Democrats will frequently remind voters of that later this year.)\nA week later, Senate Democrats tried to bring up a bill to guarantee access to IVF, which Republicans also voted down. No giant balloon for that one, though.\nRepublicans still appear hopeful they can avoid accountability for the unpopularity of their reproductive health positions, if only by highlighting other issues they hope voters care about even more \u2014 notably, the economy.
