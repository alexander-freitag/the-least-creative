Slop is everywhere on the internet, but its purest version exists on Facebook.\nThis is the Shrimp Jesus kind of slop: bizarre, obviously fake, and sometimes vaguely unsettling in a trypophobia-triggering way. Common themes involve old people holding a birthday cake asking you to wish them a happy birthday; babies doing things babies shouldn't do; snakes eating buses, bikes, or other vehicles overloaded with hundreds of babies or some other cargo; soldiers with prosthetic legs; women with missing limbs and huge busts; and Jesus. The images are often sort of eerily exploitative.\nThese tend to be posted on Facebook pages with generic-sounding names and captions that don't necessarily reflect the photo, like \"why don't photos like this ever trend,\" or \"beautiful cabin crew,\" or \"Scarlett Johansson\" for an image of Jesus built into the hood of a car.\nWhy slop? The best explanation is that the Facebook pages posting these are making bait for scam targets, helping scammers identify gullible people in the comments who they can extract money from.\nAnother possibility is that posting these images is a good tactic to build up a large page audience, which can be lucrative.\nThe vague similarities among the pages suggest the AI slop is being posted by a network of shady actors based in countries outside the US.
