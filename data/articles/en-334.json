    "content": "A new search for British teenager Jay Slater, who went missing in Tenerife, has continued on Saturday.\nHowever there is still no signs of the 19-year-old from Lancashire, 13 days after he disappeared while on holiday with friends.\nThe search included some volunteers after the Spanish police had urged voluntary organisations and members of the public with expertise in difficult conditions to help.\nDozens of experienced firefighters, police and mountain rangers focused on the ravines and trails around the village of Masca in the Rural de Teno national park. \nThe search will continue on Sunday morning, the BBC has been told. \nMr Slater has not been heard from since 17 June, after he told a friend he was lost in the mountains and had 1% battery on his phone.\nSaturday's search focused on an area previously explored but was intended to be more extensive.\nAuthorities had hoped the operation would be a “massive search” but less than 12 members of the public had arrived at the meeting point shortly before it began at 10:00 BST. \nAmong the volunteers was Paul Arnott, a British climber and TikTok personality who has been searching on the island for the past week. \nAnother volunteer, Tenerife local Livia Karczeysky, said she was taking part because she too had a 19-year-old son and would want people to do the same. \n\"I think if that something happened to him I would appreciate a lot if other people would help to find him,\" she said. \nShe added that the terrain is \"not easy, you have to be prepared\".\nSince the teenager disappeared 13 days ago, the Spanish authorities have deployed helicopter crews, specially trained search dogs and drones.\nMr Slater had been attending the NRG music festival on 16 June, and his friends said they were out in the tourist hotspot of Playa de las Americas when he was seen getting into a car with two British men he met earlier in the night.\nThe next morning he was tagged in a photo posted on Snapchat at 07:30 BST at an Airbnb in Masca, which was reportedly being rented by the two men.\nInvestigators have spoken to the pair and they are \"not in any way relevant to the case\", the media were told in a press conference on Saturday. \nBest friend Brad Hargreaves told ITV he received a video call from Mr Slater a short time later. \nHe said during that call Mr Slater appeared to slide off a designated path, with the video showing his feet on rough ground. \nHowever, Mr Slater then said he had to go as he was receiving another call. \nMr Hargreaves said: \"I don’t know how or what has gone on there but he’s gone off and rang me halfway to their house saying I’m staying here and I’ll be back the next day.\n\"He's rang me walking down the mountain and he just says he's walking home.\n\"At the time I didn't think anything of it I just thought he was going to get a bus home or a taxi home because that's what he says he is going to do.\n\"Next thing you know his phone dies and it's 10 days on now and nothing since.\"\nShortly after 08:30 BST he called another friend on the holiday with him, Lucy Law, and said he did not know where he was, needed water and had 1% battery before the call cut off.\nMr Slater's mother Debbie Duncan previously told the BBC: \"He's just an all-round nice, bubbly guy with hundreds of friends who love being in his company,\" she said.\n\"He's gorgeous, he's beautiful. He's my baby.\"\nMr Hargreaves' mother Rachel Hargreaves said she and her son were staying in Tenerife with Ms Duncan for \"as long as it takes\". \nShe said: \"You can’t put into words how you feel. I’m just here trying to support and be strong for her.\n\"The things she can’t do I am trying to do for her, mother-to-mother.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.
