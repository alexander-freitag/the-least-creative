See our ethics statement.\n’Tis the season of travel, and if you want to beef up your home security ahead of your vacation, today might be a good time to do so. Right now, you can pick up a Blink Video Doorbell with a Sync Module 2 at Best Buy, The Home Depot, and Kohl’s for just $41.99 ($28 off), which is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on the entry-level smart home bundle.\nIf you’re looking for a budget-friendly video doorbell, the battery-powered Blink Video Doorbell is one of our favorite models. The 1080p doorbell delivers all the basics, including support for motion detection, two-way video, and night vision. What’s most notable about this deal, though, is that the bundle includes Blink’s Sync Module 2, which is an optional $49.99 add-on that allows for free local storage and on-demand live views. Those are features you’d otherwise have to pay a subscription fee for, which makes some of the tradeoffs — including the doorbell’s lack of smart alerts and the fact it only works with Amazon Alexa — a little easier to overlook, especially at this price. \nBlink’s Video Doorbell is the best if you’re looking a budget-friendly buzzer that offers motion-activated recording and alerts, night vision, two-way audio, and up to two years of battery life.\nJoin more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals\n / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\n / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n© 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
