    "content": "It's one of former President Donald Trump's most regular claims on the campaign trail: give him the chance, and he'd make sure Russia's war in Ukraine was over in just a day.\nRussia clearly disagrees.\n\"The Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day,\" Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, said when asked about the claim on Monday.\nNebenzia went on to blame Ukraine's Western allies — naming in particular former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson — for getting in the way of cease-fire talks that took place in Istanbul in April 2022.\nPolitical scientist Samuel Charap and historian Sergey Radchenko, who analyzed those talks closely, have said that the idea that the West forced the negotiations to close is \"baseless.\"\nThey also noted that a lot more was on the table during those talks than leaders are willing to consider today.\nOn Monday, Nebenzia called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent statements — in which he called on Russia to withdraw from occupied territories before negotiations could take place — a \"joke.\"\nInstead, he said that any negotiations would have to take into account what he called \"the new reality that emerged during the period between April 2022 and July 2024\" — meaning Russia's territorial gains.\nRussia currently controls Crimea and large areas within four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine.\nEven if Ukraine were to accept a ceasefire by ceding territory, the negotiations would likely be complex, because Russia does not physically control the entirety of the regions it lays claim to.\n\n                                Related stories\n                              \nIn June, Putin also insisted on Ukraine's demilitarization, as well as the end of its ambitions to join NATO, as conditions for ending the war.\nTrump has so far revealed little publicly about how he would achieve the peace he claims to be able to broker.\nBut many believe it would strongly favor Russia's interests.\nThose attending a November meeting of the right-wing Heritage Foundation heard from former Trump White House aide Michael Anton that Trump's plan was expected to involve allowing Russia to keep Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine, as well as limiting NATO's expansion, The Washington Post reported.\nAnton later told the outlet he knew nothing of Trump's plans for Ukraine.\nCritics have slammed the reported plan as emboldening to Putin and highly detrimental to the US and Europe's security interests, the Post reported.\nIn March, following a meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán — Putin's closest ally within the EU — claimed that Trump's plan was simply to starve Ukraine of further military aid.\nThe Post later reported, citing an anonymous source, that Trump had never said this to Orbán.\nHowever, the move would be broadly in line with his own urgings of the MAGA wing of the Republican Party.\nEarlier this year, Trump-aligned Republicans held up $61 billion in US military aid for Ukraine, badly straining its ability to hold off Russian attacks.\nMore recently, Trump has floated the idea of replacing Ukraine aid with loans.\nTrump's claim that he could end the war almost overnight is one of the few areas where Russia and Ukraine seem to agree with each other.\nA year ago, Zelenskyy called Trump's claim a \"beautiful\" notion, but said it is not grounded in \"real-life experience.\"\n\n                                Read next\n                              \nJump to",
