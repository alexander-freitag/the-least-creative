    "content": "By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. \nApple has chosen App Store chief and former marketing head Phil Schiller to represent the company on OpenAI’s nonprofit board, according to a report from Bloomberg. Schiller will reportedly get an observer role, meaning he can attend board meetings but can’t vote or act as a director.\nJoining the board will allow Schiller to learn more about the inner workings of OpenAI as Apple works to build ChatGPT into iOS and macOS later this year. The integration will allow the AI-supercharged Siri to punt more advanced queries to ChatGPT if users grant permission. As previously reported by Bloomberg, no money is currently involved in the partnership, though Apple is expected to get a percentage of ChatGPT subscriptions made through its platforms down the road.\nLast year, Microsoft also joined the board that controls OpenAI in a non-voting observer position. Having both Apple and Microsoft on OpenAI’s board could make discussing plans with either company more complex. As Bloomberg notes, it’s quite rare for Apple execs to take board seats at companies they partner with.\nThe Verge reached out to OpenAI and Apple with a request for comment on Bloomberg’s report. We’ll update this story if we hear back.\n / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n© 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
