    "content": "Ex-Olympian Marc Jenkins decided to stand as a candidate for the Conservative Party in the general election after a heated chat with friends in the pub.\n\"I thought, 'If I'm prepared to complain, I should be prepared to do something',\" said Mr Jenkins, who is standing in Gower.\nMore than 4,500 candidates are standing in this year's vote, a record number and a 35.7% increase on the 2019 poll - you can find out who's standing in your area here.\nAlso standing in Gower is Tonia Antoniazzi for Labour, Franck Banza for the Liberal Democrats, Kieran Pritchard for Plaid Cymru, Catrin Thomas for Reform, Chris Evans for the Green Party and Wayne Erasmus, Independent.\nMr Jenkins – who represented Great Britain in triathlon in the 2004 Olympics in Athens – is one of a number of first-time candidates running in the election.\nMr Jenkins, 47, said he did not think his application would be accepted because he did not have a political background.\n\"I had a massive case of imposter syndrome,\" he said.\n\"I wanted to be able to vote for somebody like me who represented completely normal people.\"\nMr Jenkins's grandfather was a miner and he grew up in a Labour household, voting for the party for most of his life. However he said he has \"fundamentally Conservative principles\", and joined the party after Boris Johnson resigned as prime minister.\n\"I felt as a citizen we should have a choice in who leads the country. So then I joined the Conservative party and then I got interested and read a bit more about politics,\" he said.\nJoanna Stallard, 27, is another first-time candidate, standing for Labour in Dwyfor Meirionnydd, north Wales.\n\"I got to engage a lot with politics in a way that a lot of teenagers don't get the opportunity,\" she said.\nShe said she worried about the online abuse directed at women in politics, referencing the attack on Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in Copenhagen last month, saying it made her \"pause for thought\". \nHowever, she said face-to-face interactions had been \"really encouraging and positive\".\n\"People have been really receptive to a young person because how often do they see a young Welsh-speaking woman standing for politics?,\" she said.\nShe believed Labour was a natural fit for her, praising its record on gender representation, and said she was passionate about \"justice, fairness and equality of opportunity\".\nShe also said she was focused on increasing representation on Welsh issues, including the Welsh language, which she described as an \"afterthought\" in UK-wide politics.\n\"I'm focused on opportunities in general – especially the way society treats marginalised people,\" she said.\nAlso standing in Dwyfor Meirionnydd is Tomos Day for the Conservatives, Phoebe Jenkins for the Liberal Democrats, Lucy Murphy for Reform, Liz Saville-Roberts for Plaid Cymru, Karl Drinkwater for the Green Party and Joan Ginsberg for the Heritage Party.\nKiera Marshall, 25, who is standing for Plaid Cymru in Cardiff West, got into politics to fight for areas like those in which she grew up – Townhill, Swansea, which she described as \"one of Wales' poorest council estates\".\n\"The area struggled and it was very stigmatised, and that just motivates me to fight for areas like mine,\" she said.\nAt university, she said she was \"very aware of the stark difference between me and other students\".\nShe joined Plaid Cymru because of the issues she said Wales was facing, which she blamed on Conservative and Labour governments. \n\"Nearly a third of our children live in poverty,\" she said. \"I have friends who can't afford rent. We have families with children in Wales who can't afford to put food on the table.\"\nShe said her party is \"offering an alternative\".\nMs Marshall acknowledged that standing as a candidate was a big commitment, and that she had taken unpaid leave from work to campaign.\n\"I want to be out twice a day. I want to be talking to people, but it is very full on, and not everyone is able to do that,\" she said.\nAlso standing in Cardiff West is Alex Barros-Curtis for Labour, James Robert Hamblin for Conservatives, Peter Meireon Hopkins for Reform, Manda Rigby for Liberal Democrats, Neil McEvoy for Propel, Jess Ryan for the Green Party, Independent candidate John Urquhart, and Sean Wesley for the Heritage Party.\nThere are 12 parliamentary seats being contested in Surrey in the 2024 general election.\nThere are 18 parliamentary seats are being contested in Kent for the 2024 general election.\nAnimals appear at polling stations across Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Dorset and Berkshire.\nChildren and pets accompanied some of the best known faces in Scottish politics at the polling places.\nMillions are heading to polling stations across the UK.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
